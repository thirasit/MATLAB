%% Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Images Using Deep Learning
% This example shows how to perform semantic segmentation of a multispectral image with seven channels using U-Net.

% Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class.
% One application of semantic segmentation is tracking deforestation, which is the change in forest cover over time.
% Environmental agencies track deforestation to assess and quantify the environmental and ecological health of a region.

% Deep learning based semantic segmentation can yield a precise measurement of vegetation cover from high-resolution aerial photographs.
% One challenge is differentiating classes with similar visual characteristics, such as trying to classify a green pixel as grass, shrubbery, or tree.
% To increase classification accuracy, some data sets contain multispectral images that provide additional information about each pixel.
% For example, the Hamlin Beach State Park data set supplements the color images with three near-infrared channels that provide a clearer separation of the classes.

% This example first shows you how to perform semantic segmentation using a pretrained U-Net and then use the segmentation results to calculate the extent of vegetation cover.
% Then, you can optionally train a U-Net network on the Hamlin Beach State Park data set using a patch-based training methodology.
