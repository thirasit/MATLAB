%% Disk Margin and Smallest Destabilizing Perturbation
% This example shows how to interpret the WorstPerturbation field in the structure returned by diskmargin, the smallest gain and phase variation that results in closed-loop instability.

%%% Disk Margin as Range of Allowable Gain and Phase Variations
% Compute the disk margins of a SISO feedback loop with open-loop response L.
L = tf(25,[1 10 10 10]);
DM = diskmargin(L);

% The disk-based margins define a range of "safe" gain and phase variations for which the feedback loop remains stable.
% The diskmarginplot command lets you visualize this range as a region in the gain-phase plane.
% As long as gain and phase variations stay within the shaded region, the closed-loop system feedback(L,1) remains stable.
figure
diskmarginplot(DM.GainMargin)

% diskmargin models gain and phase variations as a complex-valued multiplicative factor F applied to the nominal loop transfer L.
% The set of F values is a disk whose intersection with the real axis is the interval DM.GainMargin.
% (See Stability Analysis Using Disk Margins.) diskmarginplot can also plot the F disk.
figure
diskmarginplot(DM.GainMargin,'disk')

% diskmargin also computes the smallest variation that destabilizes the feedback loop, returned in the field DM.WorstPerturbation.
% This variation is returned as a state-space model that realizes the destabilizing gain and phase variation.
% When you multiply L by this perturbation, the resulting closed-loop system has an undamped pole at the frequency returned in DM.Frequency.
WC = DM.WorstPerturbation;
CL = feedback(L*WC,1);
damp(CL)

% Verify that the gain and phase variation of the destabilizing perturbation mark a boundary point for the range of "safe" gain and phase variations.
% To do so, compute the gain and phase of WC at DM.Frequency.
hWC = freqresp(WC,DM.Frequency);

GM = mag2db(abs(hWC))

PM = 180/pi * abs(angle(hWC))

%%% Nyquist Interpretation
% The statement that the perturbation WC drives the closed-loop system unstable is equivalent to saying that the Nyquist plot of L*WC touches the critical point at the frequency DM.Frequency.
% (See Stability Analysis Using Disk Margins.) The following plot shows the Nyquist plots of L and L*WC.
% The crosses on each plot mark the response at DM.Frequency, and confirm that the response of L*WC is â€“1 at this frequency.

% The perturbation WC is dynamic and its Nyquist plot hugs the boundary of the disk of F values.
% The point of contact is the frequency DM.Frequency where the disk margin is weakest.
% The following plot uses diskmarginplot to render the disk of allowable gain and phase variations on the Nyquist plane, superimposing the response of the perturbation WC.
% The black cross again marks the response at DM.Frequency.

% Equivalently, this frequency is where the Nyquist plot of L touches the exclusion region associated with the disk margins DM.
% The following plot shows the disk of variations with the Nyquist plot of L.
% The black cross marks the response of L at DM.Frequency.

% Thus, the disk F represents a region in the Nyquist plane that the response of L cannot enter while preserving closed-loop stability.
% At the critical frequency DM.Frequency, the frequency at which the gain and phase margins are smallest, the Nyquist plot of L just touches the disk.
