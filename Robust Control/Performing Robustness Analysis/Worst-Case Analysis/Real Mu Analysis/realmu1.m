%% Real Mu Analysis
% This example shows how to use Robust Control Toolboxâ„¢ to analyze the robustness of an uncertain system with only real parametric uncertainty.
% You compute the stability margins for a rigid body transport aircraft using an output feedback control law.
% For more information about the model, see "A Practical Approach to Robustness Analysis with Aeronautical Applications" by G. Ferreres.
% Stability analysis for systems with only real parametric uncertainty can cause numerical difficulties.
% In this example, you compare three methods for computing the stability margins for systems with only real parametric uncertainty.

%%% Creating An Uncertain Model for a Transport Aircraft
% The rigid body model of a large transport aircraft has four states, two inputs, and four outputs.
% The states are sideslip (beta), roll rate (p), yaw rate (r), and roll angle (phi).
% The inputs are rudder deflection (deltap) and aileron deflection (deltar).
% The outputs are lateral acceleration (ny), roll rate (p), yaw rate (r), and roll angle(phi).
% The state equations depend on 14 aerodynamic coefficients, each coefficient having 10 percent uncertainty.

% Create the uncertainties for the aerodynamic coefficients.

AIRCRAFT = ss(A,B,C,D);

% The aircraft model has actuators for the rudder and the aileron.
% Each actuator is modeled using a second-order system and the resulting dynamics are added to the input of the rigid body model.
% P is the open-loop model of the aircraft and the actuators.

%%% Creating the Closed Loop System
% A constant output feedback control law is used and the closed loop is created with the feedback command.

%%% Stability Analysis: Power Iteration
% You can use robstab to compute robust stability margins for this system.
% This example focuses on the methods to compute lower bounds on mu, which is equivalent to computing the upper bound on the stability margin.
% By default, robstab uses a combination of power iteration and gain-based lower bound to compute the mu lower bound.
% First examine power iteration.
% The 'm' option for mussv is used to force robstab to use power iteration only.
ropt = robOptions('Mussv','m5','VaryFrequency','on');
[SM1,WCU1,INFO1] = robstab(CLOOP,ropt);

% Power iteration is fast and typically provides good bounds for problems with complex uncertainty.
% However, it tends to perform poorly for systems with only real parametric uncertainty.
% For this example, power iteration finds a lower bound of zero for mu at most frequencies.
% Thus, the stability margin upper bound provides no information.

%%% Stability Analysis: Complexify the Real Uncertainty
% One way to regularize this robust stability problem is to add a small amount of complex uncertainty to the real parametric uncertainty using the complexify command.
% Increasing alpha increases the complexity of the problem.
alpha = 0.05;
CLOOP_c = complexify(CLOOP,alpha);

% There is a trade-off when complexifying real uncertainty.
% Increasing the amount alpha of complex uncertainty improves the conditioning of the power iteration, thus increasing the chance of convergence.
% However, if you choose alpha too large, then you change the problem enough that the destabilizing perturbation for the modified problem may be far from destabilizing for the original problem.
[SM2,WC2,INFO2] = robstab(CLOOP_c,ropt);

% The plot shows the upper/lower mu bounds for the complexified problem.
% The upper bound is relatively unchanged by the complexification, and therefore complexification does not change the problem significantly.

%%% Stability Analysis: Gain-based Lower Bound
% For some problems, the amount of complexity necessary to regularize the lower bound significantly changes the problem and you should use the gain-based lower bound instead.
% Set 'g' as mussv option to force robstab to use the gain-based lower bound.
% Note that this approach is computationally slower compared to using power iteration and complexifying.
