%% Sample Uncertain Systems
% The command usample randomly samples the uncertain system at a specified number of points.
% Randomly sample an uncertain system at 20 points in its modeled uncertainty range.
% This gives a 20-by-1 ss array.
% Consequently, all analysis tools from Control System Toolboxâ„¢ are available.
p1 = ureal('p1',10,'Percentage',50); 
p2 = ureal('p2',3,'PlusMinus',[-.5 1.2]); 
p3 = ureal('p3',0); 
A = [-p1 p2; 0 -p1]; 
B = [-p2; p2+p3]; 
C = [1 0; 1 1-p3]; 
D = [0; 0]; 

sys = ss(A,B,C,D) % Create uncertain state-space model

manysys = usample(sys,20); 
size(manysys)

stepplot(manysys)

% The command stepplot can be called directly on a uss object.
% The default behavior samples the uss object at 20 instances, and plots the step responses of these 20 models, as well as the nominal value.

% The same features are available for other analysis commands such as bodeplot, bodemag, impulse, and nyquist.
