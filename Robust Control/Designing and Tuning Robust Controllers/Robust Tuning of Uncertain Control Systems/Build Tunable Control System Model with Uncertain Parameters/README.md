# **Build Tunable Control System Model with Uncertain Parameters**

Construct a generalized state-space (genss) model of a control system that has both tunable and uncertain parameters. You can use systune to tune the tunable parameters of such a model to achieve performance that is robust against the uncertainty in the system.
