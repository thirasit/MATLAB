%% Build Tunable Control System Model with Uncertain Parameters
% This example shows how to construct a generalized state-space (genss) model of a control system that has both tunable and uncertain parameters.
% You can use systune to tune the tunable parameters of such a model to achieve performance that is robust against the uncertainty in the system.

% For this example, the plant is a mass-spring-damper system.
% The input is the applied force, F, and the output is x, the position of the mass.

% In this system, the mass m, the damping constant c, and the spring constant k all have some uncertainty.
% Use uncertain ureal parameters to represent these quantities in terms of their nominal or most probable value and a range of uncertainty around that value.
um = ureal('m',3,'Percentage',40);
uc = ureal('c',1,'Percentage',20);
uk = ureal('k',2,'Percentage',30);

% The transfer function of a mass-spring-damper system is a second-order function given by:

% Create this transfer function in MATLABÂ® using the uncertain parameters and the tf command.
% The result is an uncertain state-space (uss) model.
G = tf(1,[um uc uk])

% Suppose you want to control this system with a PID controller, and that your design requirements include monitoring the response to noise at the plant input.
% Build a model of the following control system.

% Use a tunable PID controller, and insert an analysis point to provide access to the disturbance input.
C0 = tunablePID('C','PID');
d = AnalysisPoint('d');

% Connect all the components to create the control system model.
T0 = feedback(G*d*C0,1)

T0.InputName = 'r';
T0.OutputName = 'x';

% T0 is a generalized state-space (genss) model that has both tunable and uncertain blocks.
% In general, you can use feedback and other model interconnection commands, such as connect, to build up models of more complex tunable and uncertain control systems from fixed-value LTI components, uncertain components, and tunable components.

% When you plot system responses of a genss model that is both tunable and uncertain, the plot displays multiple responses computed at random values of the uncertain components.
% This sampling provides a general sense of the range of possible responses.
% All plots use the current value of the tunable components.

% When you extract responses from a tunable and uncertain genss model, the responses also contain both tunable and uncertain blocks.
% For example, examine the loop transfer function at the disturbance input.
S0 = getLoopTransfer(T0,'d')

% You can now create tuning goals and use systune to tune the PID controller coefficients of T0.
% When you do so, systune automatically tunes the coefficients to maximize performance over the full range of uncertainty.
