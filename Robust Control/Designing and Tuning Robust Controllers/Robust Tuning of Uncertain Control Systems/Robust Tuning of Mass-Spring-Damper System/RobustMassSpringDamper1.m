%% Robust Tuning of Mass-Spring-Damper System
% This example shows how to robustly tune a PID controller for an uncertain mass-spring-damper system modeled in SimulinkÂ®.

%%% Simulink Model of Mass-Spring-Damper System
% The mass-spring-damper depicted in Figure 1 is modeled by the second-order differential equation

% $$m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + k x = F$$

% where $F$ is the force applied to the mass and $x$ is the horizontal position of the mass.

% Figure 1: Mass-Spring-Damper System.

% This system is modeled in Simulink as follows:
open_system('rct_mass_spring_damper')

% We can use a PID controller to generate the effort $F$ needed to change the position $x$.
% Tuning this PID controller is easy when the physical parameters $m,c,k$ are known exactly.
% However this is rarely the case in practice, due to a number of factors including imprecise measurements, manufacturing tolerances, changes in operating conditions, and wear and tear.
% This example shows how to take such uncertainty into account during tuning to maintain high performance within the range of expected values for $m,c,k$.

%%% Uncertainty Modeling
% The Simulink model uses the "most probable" or "nominal" values of $m,c,k$:

% $$m =3 , \;\; c = 1 , \;\; k = 2 .$$

% Use the "uncertain real" (ureal) object to model the range of values that each parameter may take.
% Here the uncertainty is specified as a percentage deviation from the nominal value.
um = ureal('m',3,'Percentage',40);
uc = ureal('c',1,'Percentage',20);
uk = ureal('k',2,'Percentage',30);

%%% Nominal Tuning
% First tune the PID controller for the nominal parameter values. Here we use two simple design requirements:
% - Position $x$ should track a step change with a 1 second response time
% - Filter coefficient $N$ in PID controller should not exceed 100.
% These requirements are expressed as tuning goals:
Req1 = TuningGoal.Tracking('r','x',1);
Req2 = TuningGoal.ControllerPoles('Controller',0,0,100);

% Create an slTuner interface for tuning the "Controller" block in the Simulink model, and use systune to tune the PID gains and best meet the two requirements.
ST0 = slTuner('rct_mass_spring_damper','Controller');

ST = systune(ST0,[Req1 Req2]);

% Use getIOTransfer to view the closed-loop step response.
figure
Tnom = getIOTransfer(ST,'r','x');
step(Tnom)

% The nominal response meets the response time requirement and looks good.
% But how robust is it to variations of $m,c,k$?

%%% Robustness Analysis
% To answer this question, use the "block substitution" feature of slTuner to create an uncertain closed-loop model of the mass-spring-damper system.
% Block substitution lets you specify the linearization of a particular block in a Simulink model.
% Here we use this to replace the crisp values of $m,c,k$ by the uncertain values um,uc,uk defined above.
blocksubs(1).Name = 'rct_mass_spring_damper/Mass';
blocksubs(1).Value = 1/um;
blocksubs(2).Name = 'rct_mass_spring_damper/Damping';
blocksubs(2).Value = uc;
blocksubs(3).Name = 'rct_mass_spring_damper/Spring Stiffness';
blocksubs(3).Value = uk;
UST0 = slTuner('rct_mass_spring_damper','Controller',blocksubs);

% To assess the robustness of the nominal tuning, apply the tuned PID gains to the (untuned) uncertain model UST0 and simulate the "uncertain" closed-loop response.
% Apply result of nominal tuning (ST) to uncertain closed-loop model UST0
figure
setBlockValue(UST0,getBlockValue(ST));
Tnom = getIOTransfer(UST0,'r','x');
rng(0), step(Tnom,25), grid

% The step plot shows the closed-loop response with the nominally tuned PID for 20 randomly selected values of $m,c,k$ in the specified uncertainty range.
% Observe the significant performance degradation for some parameter combinations, with poorly damped oscillations and a long settling time.

%%% Robust Tuning
% To improve the robustness of the PID controller, re-tune it using the uncertain closed-loop model UST0 rather than the nominal closed-loop model ST0.
% Due to the presence of ureal components in the model, systune automatically tries to maximize performance over the entire uncertainty range.
% This amounts to minimizing the worst-case value of the "soft" tuning goals Req1 and Req2.
UST0 = slTuner('rct_mass_spring_damper','Controller',blocksubs);

UST = systune(UST0,[Req1 Req2]);

% The robust performance is only slightly worse than the nominal performance, but the same uncertain closed-loop simulation shows a significant improvement over the nominal design.

Trob = getIOTransfer(UST,'r','x');

% This is confirmed by plotting the worst-case gain from $r$ to $x$ as a function of frequency.
% Note the attenuated resonance near 1 rad/s.

% A comparison of the two PID controllers shows similar behaviors except for one key difference.
% The nominally tuned PID excessively relies on "cancelling" (notching out) the plant resonance, which is not a robust strategy in the presence of uncertainty on the resonance frequency.

% For further insight, plot the performance index (maximum value of the "soft" tuning goals Req1,Req2) as a function of the uncertain parameters $m,k$ for the nominal damping $c=1$.
% Use the "varying parameter" feature of slTuner to create an array of closed-loop models over a grid of $m,k$ values covering their uncertainty ranges.
% Specify a 6-by-6 grid of (m,k) values for linearization
ms = linspace(um.Range(1),um.Range(2),6);
ks = linspace(uk.Range(1),uk.Range(2),6);
[ms,ks] = ndgrid(ms,ks);

params(1).Value = ms;
params(2).Name = 'k';

setBlockValue(STP,'Controller',Crob)
[~,F1] = evalGoal(Req1,STP);

% This plot shows that the nominal tuning is very sensitive to changes in mass $m$ or spring stiffness $k$, while the robust tuning is essentially insensitive to these parameters.
% To complete the design, use writeBlockValue to apply the robust PID gains to the Simulink model and proceed with further validation in Simulink.
