# **Control of a Spring-Mass-Damper System Using Mixed-Mu Synthesis**

Perform mixed-mu synthesis with the musyn command in the Robust Control Toolboxâ„¢. Here musyn is used to design a robust controller for a two mass-spring-damper system with uncertainty in the spring stiffness connecting the two masses. This example is taken from the paper "Robust mixed-mu synthesis performance for mass-spring system with stiffness uncertainty," D. Barros, S. Fekri and M. Athans, 2005 Mediterranean Control Conference.
