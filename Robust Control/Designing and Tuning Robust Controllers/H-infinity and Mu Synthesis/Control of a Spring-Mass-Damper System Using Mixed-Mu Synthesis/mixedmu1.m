%% Control of a Spring-Mass-Damper System Using Mixed-Mu Synthesis
% This example shows how to perform mixed-mu synthesis with the musyn command in the Robust Control Toolboxâ„¢.
% Here musyn is used to design a robust controller for a two mass-spring-damper system with uncertainty in the spring stiffness connecting the two masses.
% This example is taken from the paper "Robust mixed-mu synthesis performance for mass-spring system with stiffness uncertainty," D. Barros, S. Fekri and M. Athans, 2005 Mediterranean Control Conference.

%%% Performance Specifications
% Consider the mass-spring-damper system in Figure 1.
% Spring k2 and damper b2 are attached to the wall and mass m2.
% Mass m2 is also attached to mass m1 through spring k1 and damper b1.
% Mass 2 is affected by the disturbance force f2.
% The system is controlled via force f1 acting on mass m1.

% Our design goal is to use the control force f1 to attenuate the effect of the disturbance f2 on the position of mass m2.
% The force f1 does not directly act on mass m2, rather it acts through the spring stiffness k1.
% Hence any uncertainty in the spring stiffness k1 will make the control problem more difficult.
% The control problem is formulated as:
% - The controller measures the noisy displacement of mass m2 and applies the control force f1. The sensor noise, Wn, is modeled as a constant 0.001.
% - The actuator command is penalized by a factor 0.1 at low frequency and a factor 10 at high frequency with a crossover frequency of 100 rad/s (filter Wu).
% - The unit magnitude, first-order coloring filter, Wdist, on the disturbance has a pole at 0.25 rad/s.
% - The performance objective is to attenuate the disturbance on mass m2 by a factor of 80 below 0.1 rad/s.

% The nominal values of the system parameters are m1=1, m2=2, k2=1, b1=0.05, b2=0.05, and k1=2.
Wn = tf(0.001);
Wu = 10*tf([1 10],[1 1000]);
Wdist = tf(0.25,[1 0.25],'inputname','dist','outputname','f2');
Wp = 80*tf(0.1,[1 0.1]);
m1 = 1;
m2 = 2;
k2 = 1;
b1 = 0.05;
b2 = 0.05;

%%% Uncertainty Modeling
% The value of spring stiffness k1 is uncertain.
% It has a nominal value of 2 and its value can vary between 1.2 and 2.8.
k1 = ureal('k1',2,'Range',[1.2 2.8]);

% There is also a time delay tau between the commanded actuator force f1 and its application to mass m1.
% The maximum delay is 0.06 seconds.
% Neglecting this time delay introduces a multiplicative error of exp(-s*tau)-1.
% This error can be treated as unmodeled dynamics bounded in magnitude by the high-pass filter Wunmod = 2.6*s/(s + 40):

tau = ss(1,'InputDelay',0.06);

% Construct an uncertain state-space model of the plant with the control force f1 and disturbance f2 as inputs.
a1c = [0 0 -1/m1  1/m2]'*k1;
a2c = [0 0  1/m1 -1/m2]'*k1 + [0 0 0 -k2/m2]';

plant.OutputName = {'z2'};

% Add the unmodeled delay dynamics at the first plant input.

%%% Control Design
% We use the following structure for controller synthesis:

% Figure 2

% Use connect to construct the corresponding open-loop interconnection IC.
% Note that IC is an uncertain model with uncertain variables k1 and Delta.
Wu.u = 'f1';  Wu.y = 'Wu';
Wp.u = 'z2';  Wp.y = 'Wp';

IC = connect(plant,Wdist,Wu,Wp,Wn,S,{'dist','noise','f1'},{'Wp','Wu','z2n'})

%%% Complex mu-Synthesis
% You can use the command musyn to synthesize a robust controller for the open-loop interconnection IC.
% By default, musyn treats all uncertain real parameters, in this example k1, as complex uncertainty.
% Recall that k1 is a real parameter with a nominal value of 2 and a range between 1.2 and 2.8.
% In complex mu-synthesis, it is replaced by a complex uncertain parameter varying in a disk centered at 2 and with radius 0.8.
% The plot below compares the range of k1 values when k1 is treated as real (red x) vs. complex (blue *).

% Synthesize a robust controller Kc using complex mu-synthesis (treating k1 as a complex parameter).
[Kc,mu_c,infoc] = musyn(IC,1,1);

% Note that mu_c exceeds 1 so the controller Kc fails to robustly achieve the desired performance level.

%%% Mixed-Mu Synthesis
% Mixed-mu synthesis accounts for uncertain real parameters directly in the synthesis process.
% Enable mixed-mu synthesis by setting the MixedMU option to 'on'.
opt = musynOptions('MixedMU','on');
[Km,mu_m] = musyn(IC,1,1,opt);

% Mixed-mu synthesis is able to find a controller that achieves the desired performance and robustness objectives.
% A comparison of the open-loop responses shows that the mixed-mu controller Km gives less phase margin near 3 rad/s because it only needs to guard against real variations of k1.

%%% Worst-Case Analysis
% A comparison of the two controllers indicates that taking advantage of the "realness" of k1 results in a better performing, more robust controller.

% To assess the worst-case closed-loop performance of Kc and Km, form the closed-loop interconnection of Figure 2 and use the command wcgain to determine how large the disturbance-to-error norm can get for the specified plant uncertainty.
clpKc = lft(IC,Kc);
clpKm = lft(IC,Km);
[maxgainKc,badpertKc] = wcgain(clpKc);
maxgainKc

[maxgainKm,badpertKm] = wcgain(clpKm);
maxgainKm

% The mixed-mu controller Km has a worst-case gain of 0.88 while the complex-mu controller Kc has a worst-case gain of 2.2, or 2.5 times larger.

%%% Disturbance Rejection Simulations
% To compare the disturbance rejection performance of Kc and Km, first build closed-loop models of the transfer from input disturbance dist to f2, f1, and z2 (position of the mass m2)

clsimKm = connect(plant,Wdist,Km,'dist',{'f2','f1','z2'});
Kc.u = 'z2';  Kc.y = 'f1';
clsimKc = connect(plant,Wdist,Kc,'dist',{'f2','f1','z2'});

% Inject white noise into the low-pass filter Wdist to simulate the input disturbance f2.
% The nominal closed-loop performance of the two designs is nearly identical.
t = 0:.01:100;
dist = randn(size(t));
yKc = lsim(clsimKc.Nominal,dist,t);
yKm = lsim(clsimKm.Nominal,dist,t);

% Next, compare the worst-case scenarios for Kc and Km by setting the plant uncertainty to the worst-case values computed with wcgain.
clsimKc_wc = usubs(clsimKc,badpertKc);
clsimKm_wc = usubs(clsimKm,badpertKm);
yKc_wc = lsim(clsimKc_wc,dist,t);
yKm_wc = lsim(clsimKm_wc,dist,t);

% This shows that the mixed-mu controller Km significantly outperforms Kc in the worst-case scenario.
% By exploiting the fact that k1 is real, the mixed-mu controller is able to deliver better performance at equal robustness.

%%% Controller Simplification
% The mixed-mu controller Km has relatively high order compared to the plant.
% To obtain a simpler controller, use musyn's fixed-order tuning capability.
% This uses hinfstruct instead of hinfsyn for the synthesis step.
% You can try different orders to find the simplest controller that maintains robust performance.
% For example, try tuning a fifth-order controller.
% Use the "RandomStart" option to run several mu-synthesis cycles, each starting from a different initial value of K.
K = tunableSS('K',5,1,1);  % 5th-order tunable state-space model

opt = musynOptions('MixedMU','on','MaxIter',20,'RandomStart',2);
rng(0), [CL,mu_f] = musyn(lft(IC,K),opt);

% The best controller nearly delivers the desired robust performance (robust performance mu_f is close to 1).
% Compare the two controllers.
