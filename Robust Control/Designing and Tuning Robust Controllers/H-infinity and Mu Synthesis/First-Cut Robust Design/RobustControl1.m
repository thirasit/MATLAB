%% First-Cut Robust Design
% This example shows how to use the Robust Control Toolboxâ„¢ commands usample, ucover and musyn to design a robust controller with standard performance objectives.
% It can serve as a template for more complex robust control design tasks.

%%% Introduction
% The plant model consists of a first-order system with uncertain gain and time constant in series with a mildly underdamped resonance and significant unmodeled dynamics.
% The uncertain variables are specified using ureal and ultidyn and the uncertain plant model P is constructed as a product of simple transfer functions:
gamma = ureal('gamma',2,'Perc',30);  % uncertain gain
tau = ureal('tau',1,'Perc',30);      % uncertain time-constant
wn = 50; xi = 0.25;
P = tf(gamma,[tau 1]) * tf(wn^2,[1 2*xi*wn wn^2]);
% Add unmodeled dynamics
delta = ultidyn('delta',[1 1],'SampleStateDim',5,'Bound',1);
W = makeweight(0.1,20,10);
P = P * (1+W*delta);

% A collection of step responses for randomly sampled uncertainty values illustrates the plant variability.

step(P,5)

%%% Covering the Uncertain Model
% The uncertain plant model P contains 3 uncertain elements.
% For feedback design purposes, it is often desirable to simplify the uncertainty model while approximately retaining its overall variability.
% This is one use of the command ucover.
% This command takes an array of LTI responses Pa and a nominal response Pn and models the difference Pa-Pn as multiplicative uncertainty in the system dynamics (ultidyn).

% To use ucover, first map the uncertain model P into a family of LTI responses using usample.
% This command samples the uncertain elements in an uncertain system.
% It returns an array of LTI models where each model representing one possible behavior of the uncertain system.
% In this example, generate 60 sample values of P:
rng('default');     % the random number generator is seeded for repeatability
Parray = usample(P,60);

% Next, use ucover to cover all behaviors in Parray by a simple uncertain model of the form
%Usys = Pn * (1 + Wt * Delta)
% where all the uncertainty is concentrated in the "unmodeled dynamics" component Delta (a ultidyn object).
% Choose the nominal value of P as center Pn of the cover, and use a 2nd-order shaping filter Wt to capture how the relative gap between Parray and Pn varies with frequency.
Pn = P.NominalValue;
orderWt = 2;
Parrayg = frd(Parray,logspace(-3,3,60));
[Usys,Info] = ucover(Parrayg,Pn,orderWt,'in');

% Verify that the filter magnitude (in red) "covers" the relative variations of the plant frequency response (in blue).

%%% Creating the Open-Loop Design Model
% To design a robust controller for the uncertain plant P, choose a target closed-loop bandwidth desBW and perform a sensitivity-minimization design using the simplified uncertainty model Usys.
% The control structure is shown in Figure 1.
% The main signals are the disturbance d, the measurement noise n, the control signal u, and the plant output y.
% The filters Wperf and Wnoise reflect the frequency content of the disturbance and noise signals, or equivalently, the frequency bands where good disturbance and noise rejection properties are needed.

% Our goal is to keep y close to zero by rejecting the disturbance d and minimizing the impact of the measurement noise n.
% Equivalently, we want to design a controller that keeps the gain from [d;n] to y "small." Note that
% y  = Wperf * 1/(1+PC) * d + Wnoise * PC/(1+PC) * n
% so the transfer function of interest consists of performance- and noise-weighted versions of the sensitivity function 1/(1+PC) and complementary sensitivity function PC/(1+PC).

% Figure 1: Control Structure.

% Choose the performance weighting function Wperf as a first-order low-pass filter with magnitude greater than 1 at frequencies below the desired closed-loop bandwidth:
desBW = 0.4;
Wperf = makeweight(500,desBW,0.5);

% To limit the controller bandwidth and induce roll off beyond the desired bandwidth, use a sensor noise model Wnoise with magnitude greater than 1 at frequencies greater than 10*desBW:
Wnoise = 0.0025 * tf([25 7 1],[2.5e-5 .007 1]);

% Plot the magnitude profiles of Wperf and Wnoise:

bodemag(Wperf,'b',Wnoise,'r'), grid
title('Performance weight and sensor noise model')
legend('Wperf','Wnoise','Location','SouthEast')

% Next build the open-loop interconnection of Figure 1:
Usys.InputName = 'u'; Usys.OutputName = 'yp';
Wperf.InputName = 'd'; Wperf.OutputName = 'yd';
Wnoise.InputName = 'n'; Wnoise.OutputName = 'yn';

sumy = sumblk('y = yp + yd');
sume = sumblk('e = -y - yn');

M = connect(Usys,Wperf,Wnoise,sumy,sume,{'d','n','u'},{'y','e'});

%%% First Design: Low Bandwidth Requirement
% The controller design is carried out with the automated robust design command musyn.
% The uncertain open-loop model is given by M.
[ny,nu] = size(Usys);
[K1,muBound] = musyn(M,ny,nu);

% The robust performance muBound is a positive scalar.
% If it is near 1, then the design is successful and the desired and effective closed-loop bandwidths match closely.
% As a rule of thumb, if muBound is less than 0.85, then the achievable performance can be improved.
% When muBound is greater than 1.2, then the desired closed-loop bandwidth is not achievable for the given amount of plant uncertainty.

% Since, here, muBound is approximately 0.9, the objectives are met, but could ultimately be improved upon.
% For validation purposes, create Bode plots of the open-loop response for different values of the uncertainty and note the typical zero-dB crossover frequency and phase margin:
figure
opt = bodeoptions;
opt.PhaseMatching = 'on';
opt.Grid = 'on';

bodeplot(Parray*K1,{1e-2,1e2},opt);

% Randomized closed-loop Bode plots confirm a closed-loop disturbance rejection bandwidth of approximately 0.4 rad/s.
figure
S1 = feedback(1,Parray*K1);  % sensitivity to output disturbance
bodemag(S1,{1e-2,1e3}), grid

% Finally, compute and plot the closed-loop responses to a step disturbance at the plant output.
% These are consistent with the desired closed-loop bandwidth of 0.4, with settling times approximately 7 seconds.
figure
step(S1,8);

% In this naive design strategy, we have correlated the noise bandwidth with the desired closed-loop bandwidth.
% This simply helps limit the controller bandwidth.
% A fair perspective is that this approach focuses on output disturbance attenuation in the face of plant model uncertainty.
% Sensor noise is not truly addressed.
% Problems with considerable amounts of sensor noise would be dealt with in a different manner.

%%% Second Design: Higher Bandwidth Requirement
% Let's redo the design for a higher target bandwidth and adjusting the noise bandwidth as well.
desBW = 2;
Wperf = makeweight(500,desBW,0.5);
Wperf.InputName = 'd'; Wperf.OutputName = 'yd';
Wnoise = 0.0025 * tf([1 1.4 1],[1e-6 0.0014 1]);
Wnoise.InputName = 'n'; Wnoise.OutputName = 'yn';

M = connect(Usys,Wperf,Wnoise,sumy,sume,{'d','n','u'},{'y','e'});
[K2,muBound2] = musyn(M,ny,nu);

% With a robust performance of about 1.1, this design achieves a good tradeoff between performance goals and plant uncertainty.
% Open-loop Bode plots confirm a fairly robust design with decent phase margins, but not as good as the lower bandwidth design.
figure
bodeplot(Parray*K2,{1e-2,1e2},opt)

% Randomized closed-loop Bode plots confirm a closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 2 rad/s.
% The frequency response has a bit more peaking than was seen in the lower bandwidth design, due to the increased uncertainty in the model at this frequency.
% Since the Robust Performance mu-value was 1.1, we expected some degradation in the robustness of the performance objectives over the lower bandwidth design.
figure
S2 = feedback(1,Parray*K2);
bodemag(S2,{1e-2,1e3}), grid

% Closed-loop step disturbance responses further illustrate the higher bandwidth response, with reasonable robustness across the plant model variability.
figure
step(S2,8);

%%% Third Design: Very Aggressive Bandwidth Requirement
% Redo the design once more with an extremely optimistic closed-loop bandwidth goal of 15 rad/s.
desBW = 15;
Wperf = makeweight(500,desBW,0.5);
Wperf.InputName = 'd'; Wperf.OutputName = 'yd';
Wnoise = 0.0025 * tf([0.018 0.19 1],[0.018e-6 0.19e-3 1]);
Wnoise.InputName = 'n'; Wnoise.OutputName = 'yn';

M = connect(Usys,Wperf,Wnoise,sumy,sume,{'d','n','u'},{'y','e'});
[K3,muBound3] = musyn(M,ny,nu);

% Since the robust performance is greater than 1.8, the closed-loop performance goals are not achieved under plant uncertainties.
% The frequency responses of the closed-loop system have higher peaks indicating the poor performance of the designed controller.
figure
S3 = feedback(1,Parray*K3);
bodemag(S3,{1e-2,1e3}), grid

% Similarly, step responses under uncertainties illustrate the poor closed-loop performance.
figure
step(S3,1);

%%% Robust Stability Calculations
% The Bode and Step response plots shown above are generated from samples of the uncertain plant model P.
% We can use the uncertain model directly, and assess the robust stability of the three closed-loop systems.
ropt = robOptions('Display','on','MussvOptions','sm5');
stabmarg1 = robstab(feedback(P,K1),ropt);

stabmarg2 = robstab(feedback(P,K2),ropt);

stabmarg3 = robstab(feedback(P,K3),ropt);

% The robustness analysis reports confirm what we have observed by sampling the closed-loop time and frequency responses.
% The second design is a good compromise between performance and robustness, and the third design is too aggressive and lacks robustness.
