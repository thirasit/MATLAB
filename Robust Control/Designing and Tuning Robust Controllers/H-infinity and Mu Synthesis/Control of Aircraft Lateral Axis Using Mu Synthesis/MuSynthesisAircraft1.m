% The design goal is to make the airplane respond effectively to the pilot's lateral stick and rudder pedal inputs.
% The performance specifications include:
% - Decoupled responses from lateral stick p_cmd to roll rate p and from rudder pedals beta_cmd to side-slip angle beta. The lateral stick and rudder pedals have a maximum deflection of +/- 1 inch.
% - The aircraft handling quality (HQ) response from lateral stick to roll rate p should match the first-order response.

% - The aircraft handling quality response from the rudder pedals to the side-slip angle beta should match the damped second-order response.

% Figure 3: Desired response from rudder pedal to side-slip angle.
% - The stabilizer actuators have +/- 20 deg and +/- 50 deg/s limits on their deflection angle and deflection rate. The rudder actuators have +/- 30 deg and +/-60 deg/s deflection angle and rate limits.
% - The three measurement signals ( roll rate p, yaw rate r, and lateral acceleration yac ) are filtered through second-order anti-aliasing filters:
freq = 12.5 * (2*pi);  % 12.5 Hz
zeta = 0.5;
yaw_filt = tf(freq^2,[1 2*zeta*freq freq^2]);
lat_filt = tf(freq^2,[1 2*zeta*freq freq^2]);

freq = 4.1 * (2*pi);  % 4.1 Hz
zeta = 0.7;
roll_filt = tf(freq^2,[1 2*zeta*freq freq^2]);

AAFilters = append(roll_filt,yaw_filt,lat_filt);

%%% From Specs to Weighting Functions
% H-infinity design algorithms seek to minimize the largest closed-loop gain across frequency (H-infinity norm).
% To apply these tools, we must first recast the design specifications as constraints on the closed-loop gains.
% We use weighting functions to "normalize" the specifications across frequency and to equally weight each requirement.
% We can express the design specs in terms of weighting functions as follows:

% - To capture the limits on the actuator deflection magnitude and rate, pick a diagonal, constant weight W_act, corresponding to the stabilizer and rudder deflection rate and deflection angle limits.
W_act = ss(diag([1/50,1/20,1/60,1/30]));

% - Use a 3x3 diagonal, high-pass filter W_n to model the frequency content of the sensor noise in the roll rate, yaw rate, and lateral acceleration channels.

W_n = append(0.025,tf(0.0125*[1 1],[1 100]),0.025);

% Figure 4: Sensor noise power as a function of frequency
% - The response from lateral stick to p and from rudder pedal to beta should match the handling quality targets HQ_p and HQ_beta.
% - This is a model-matching objective: to minimize the difference (peak gain) between the desired and actual closed-loop transfer functions.
% - Performance is limited due to a right-half plane zero in the model at 0.002 rad/s, so accurate tracking of sinusoids below 0.002 rad/s is not possible.
% - Accordingly, we'll weight the first handling quality spec with a bandpass filter W_p that emphasizes the frequency range between 0.06 and 30 rad/sec.
figure
W_p = tf([0.05 2.9 105.93 6.17 0.16],[1 9.19 30.80 18.83 3.95]);
clf, bodemag(W_p), title('Weight on Handling Quality spec')

% Figure 5: Weight on handling quality spec.
% - Similarly, pick W_beta=2*W_p for the second handling quality spec
W_beta = 2*W_p;

% Here we scaled the weights W_act, W_n, W_p, and W_beta so the closed-loop gain between all external inputs and all weighted outputs is less than 1 at all frequencies.

%%% Nominal Aircraft Model
% A pilot can command the lateral-directional response of the aircraft with the lateral stick and rudder pedals. The aircraft has the following characteristics:
% - Two control inputs: differential stabilizer deflection delta_stab in degrees, and rudder deflection delta_rud in degrees.
% - Three measured outputs: roll rate p in deg/s, yaw rate r in deg/s, and lateral acceleration yac in g's.
% - One calculated output: side-slip angle beta.

% The nominal lateral directional model LateralAxis has four states:
% - Lateral velocity v
% - Yaw rate r
% - Roll rate p
% - Roll angle phi

%%% Accounting for Modeling Errors
% The nominal model only approximates true airplane behavior.
% To account for unmodeled dynamics, you can introduce a relative term or multiplicative uncertainty W_in*Delta_G at the plant input, where the error dynamics Delta_G have gain less than 1 across frequencies, and the weighting function W_in reflects the frequency ranges in which the model is more or less accurate.
% There are typically more modeling errors at high frequencies so W_in is high pass.

%%% Building an Uncertain Model of the Aircraft Dynamics
% Now that we have quantified modeling errors, we can build an uncertain model of the aircraft dynamics corresponding to the dashed box in the Figure 7 (same as Figure 1):

% Figure 7: Aircraft dynamics.
% Use the connect function to combine the nominal airframe model LateralAxis, the actuator models A_S and A_R, and the modeling error description W_in*Delta_G into a single uncertain model Plant_unc mapping [delta_stab; delta_rud] to the actuator and plant outputs:
% Actuator model with modeling uncertainty
Act_unc = append(A_S,A_R) * (eye(2) + W_in*Delta_G);
Act_unc.InputName = {'delta_stab','delta_rud'};

% Nominal aircraft dynamics
Plant_nom = LateralAxis;
Plant_nom.InputName = {'stab_angle','rud_angle'};

% Connect the two subsystems
Inputs = {'delta_stab','delta_rud'};
Outputs = [A_S.y ; A_R.y ; Plant_nom.y];
Plant_unc = connect(Plant_nom,Act_unc,Inputs,Outputs);

% This produces an uncertain state-space (USS) model Plant_unc of the aircraft:
Plant_unc

%%% Analyzing How Modeling Errors Affect Open-Loop Responses
% We can analyze the effect of modeling uncertainty by picking random samples of the unmodeled dynamics Delta_G and plotting the nominal and perturbed time responses (Monte Carlo analysis).
% For example, for the differential stabilizer channel, the uncertainty weight w_1 implies a 5% modeling error at low frequency, increasing to 100% after 93 rad/sec, as confirmed by the Bode diagram below.

% Pick 10 random samples
Plant_unc_sampl = usample(Plant_unc,10);

% Look at response from differential stabilizer to beta

%%% Designing the Lateral-Axis Controller
% Proceed with designing a controller that robustly achieves the specifications, where robustly means for any perturbed aircraft model consistent with the modeling error bounds W_in.

% First we build an open-loop model OLIC mapping the external input signals to the performance-related outputs as shown below.

% This produces the uncertain state-space model
OLIC

% Recall that by construction of the weighting functions, a controller meets the specs whenever the closed-loop gain is less than 1 at all frequencies and for all I/O directions.
% First design an H-infinity controller that minimizes the closed-loop gain for the nominal aircraft model:
nmeas = 5;		% number of measurements
nctrls = 2;		% number of controls
[kinf,~,gamma_inf] = hinfsyn(OLIC.NominalValue,nmeas,nctrls);
gamma_inf

% Here hinfsyn computed a controller kinf that keeps the closed-loop gain below 1 so the specs can be met for the nominal aircraft model.

% Next, perform a mu-synthesis to see if the specs can be met robustly when taking into account the modeling errors (uncertainty Delta_G).
% Use the command musyn to perform the synthesis and use musynOptions to set the frequency grid used for mu-analysis.
fmu = logspace(-2,2,60);
opt = musynOptions('FrequencyGrid',fmu);
[kmu,CLperf] = musyn(OLIC,nmeas,nctrls,opt);

CLperf

% Here the best controller kmu cannot keep the closed-loop gain below 1 for the specified model uncertainty, indicating that the specs can be nearly but not fully met for the family of aircraft models under consideration.

%%% Frequency-Domain Comparison of Controllers
% Compare the performance and robustness of the H-infinity controller kinf and mu controller kmu.
% Recall that the performance specs are achieved when the closed loop gain is less than 1 for every frequency.
% Use the lft function to close the loop around each controller:
clinf = lft(OLIC,kinf);
clmu = lft(OLIC,kmu);

% What is the worst-case performance (in terms of closed-loop gain) of each controller for modeling errors bounded by W_in? The wcgain command helps you answer this difficult question directly without need for extensive gridding and simulation.

% Compute worst-case gain as a function of frequency
opt = wcOptions('VaryFrequency','on');

% Compute worst-case gain (as a function of frequency) for kinf
[mginf,wcuinf,infoinf] = wcgain(clinf,opt);

% Compute worst-case gain for kmu
[mgmu,wcumu,infomu] = wcgain(clmu,opt);

% You can now compare the nominal and worst-case performance for each controller:
figure
subplot(211)
f = infoinf.Frequency;
gnom = sigma(clinf.NominalValue,f);
semilogx(f,gnom(1,:),'r',f,infoinf.Bounds(:,2),'b');

xlabel('Frequency (rad/sec)')
ylabel('Closed-loop gain');
xlim([1e-2 1e2])
legend('Nominal Plant','Worst-Case','Location','SouthWest');

% The first plot shows that while the H-infinity controller kinf meets the performance specs for the nominal plant model, its performance can sharply deteriorate (peak gain near 15) for some perturbed model within our modeling error bounds.

% In contrast, the mu controller kmu has slightly worse performance for the nominal plant when compared to kinf, but it maintains this performance consistently for all perturbed models (worst-case gain near 1.25).
% The mu controller is therefore more robust to modeling errors.

%%% Time-Domain Validation of the Robust Controller
% To further test the robustness of the mu controller kmu in the time domain, you can compare the time responses of the nominal and worst-case closed-loop models with the ideal "Handling Quality" response.
% To do this, first construct the "true" closed-loop model CLSIM where all weighting functions and HQ reference models have been removed:
kmu.u = {'p_cmd','beta_cmd','p_meas','r_meas','yac_meas'};
kmu.y = {'delta_stab','delta_rud'};

AAFilters.y = {'p_meas','r_meas','yac_meas'};

CLSIM = connect(Plant_unc(5:end,:),AAFilters,kmu,{'p_cmd','beta_cmd'},{'p','beta'});

% Next, create the test signals u_stick and u_pedal shown below
time = 0:0.02:15;
u_stick = (time>=9 & time<12);
u_pedal = (time>=1 & time<4) - (time>=4 & time<7);

subplot(212), plot(time,u_pedal), axis([0 14 -2 2]), title('Rudder pedal command')

% You can now compute and plot the ideal, nominal, and worst-case responses to the test commands u_stick and u_pedal.
% Ideal behavior
IdealResp = append(HQ_p,HQ_beta);
IdealResp.y = {'p','beta'};

% Worst-case response
WCResp = usubs(CLSIM,wcumu);

% Compare responses

lsim(IdealResp,'g',CLSIM.NominalValue,'r',WCResp,'b:',[u_stick ; u_pedal],time)
legend('ideal','nominal','perturbed','Location','SouthEast');
title('Closed-loop responses with mu controller KMU')

% The closed-loop response is nearly identical for the nominal and worst-case closed-loop systems.
% Note that the roll-rate response of the aircraft tracks the roll-rate command well initially and then departs from this command.
% This is due to a right-half plane zero in the aircraft model at 0.024 rad/sec.
