%%% Plant Description
% The plant in our example consists of two water tanks in cascade as shown schematically in Figure 1.
% The upper tank (tank 1) is fed by hot and cold water via computer-controlled valves.
% The lower tank (tank 2) is fed by water from an exit at the bottom of tank 1.
% An overflow maintains a constant level in tank 2.
% A cold water bias stream also feeds tank 2 and enables the tanks to have different steady-state temperatures.

% Our design objective is to control the temperatures of both tanks 1 and 2.
% The controller has access to the reference commands and the temperature measurements.

%%% Tank Variables
% Let's give the plant variables the following designations:
% - fhc: Command to hot flow actuator
% - fh: Hot water flow into tank 1
% - fcc: Command to cold flow actuator
% - fc: Cold water flow into tank 1
% - f1: Total flow out of tank 1
% - A1: Cross-sectional area of tank 1
% - h1: Tank 1 water level
% - t1: Temperature of tank 1
% - t2: Temperature of tank 2
% - A2: Cross-sectional area of tank 2
% - h2: Tank 2 water level
% - fb: Flow rate of tank 2 bias stream
% - tb: Temperature of tank 2 bias stream
% - th: Hot water supply temperature
% - tc: Cold water supply temperature

% For convenience we define a system of normalized units as follows:
%  Variable      Unit Name      0 means:             1 means:
%  --------      ---------      --------             --------
%  temperature   tunit          cold water temp.     hot water temp.
%  height        hunit          tank empty           tank full
%  flow          funit          zero input flow      max. input flow

% Using the above units, these are the plant parameters:
A1 = 0.0256;	% Area of tank 1 (hunits^2)
A2 = 0.0477;	% Area of tank 2 (hunits^2)
h2 = 0.241;	    % Height of tank 2, fixed by overflow (hunits)
fb = 3.28e-5;   % Bias stream flow (hunits^3/sec)
fs = 0.00028;	% Flow scaling (hunits^3/sec/funit)
th = 1.0;	    % Hot water supply temp (tunits)
tc = 0.0;	    % Cold water supply temp (tunits)
tb = tc;	    % Cold bias stream temp (tunits)
alpha = 4876;   % Constant for flow/height relation (hunits/funits)
beta = 0.59;    % Constant for flow/height relation (hunits)

% The variable fs is a flow-scaling factor that converts the input (0 to 1 funits) to flow in hunits^3/second.
% The constants alpha and beta describe the flow/height relationship for tank 1:
% h1 = alpha*f1-beta.

%%% Nominal Tank Models
% We can obtain the nominal tank models by linearizing around the following operating point (all normalized values):
h1ss = 0.75;                            % Water level for tank 1
t1ss = 0.75;                            % Temperature of tank 1
f1ss = (h1ss+beta)/alpha;               % Flow tank 1 -> tank 2
fss = [th,tc;1,1]\[t1ss*f1ss;f1ss];
fhss = fss(1);                          % Hot flow
fcss = fss(2);                          % Cold flow
t2ss = (f1ss*t1ss + fb*tb)/(f1ss + fb); % Temperature of tank 2

% The nominal model for tank 1 has inputs [ fh; fc] and outputs [ h1; t1]:
A = [ -1/(A1*alpha),          0;
      (beta*t1ss)/(A1*h1ss),  -(h1ss+beta)/(alpha*A1*h1ss)];

B = fs*[ 1/(A1*alpha),   1/(A1*alpha);
         th/A1,          tc/A1];

C = [ alpha,             0;
      -alpha*t1ss/h1ss,  1/h1ss];

%%% Actuator Models
% There are significant dynamics and saturations associated with the actuators, so we'll want to include actuator models.
% In the frequency range we're using, we can model the actuators as a first order system with rate and magnitude saturations.
% It is the rate limit, rather than the pole location, that limits the actuator performance for most signals.
% For a linear model, some of the effects of rate limiting can be included in a perturbation model.

% We initially set up the actuator model with one input (the command signal) and two outputs (the actuated signal and its derivative).
% We'll use the derivative output in limiting the actuation rate when designing the control law.

%%% Uncertainty on Model Dynamics
% Open-loop experiments reveal some variability in the system responses and suggest that the linear models are good at low frequency.
% If we fail to take this information into account during the design, our controller might perform poorly on the real system.
% For this reason, we will build an uncertainty model that matches our estimate of uncertainty in the physical system as closely as possible.
% Because the amount of model uncertainty or variability typically depends on frequency, our uncertainty model involves frequency-dependent weighting functions to normalize modeling errors across frequency.

% For example, open-loop experiments indicate a significant amount of dynamic uncertainty in the t1 response.
% This is due primarily to mixing and heat loss.
% We can model it as a multiplicative (relative) model error Delta2 at the t1 output.
% Similarly, we can add multiplicative model errors Delta1 and Delta3 to the h1 and t2 outputs as shown in Figure 5.

imshow("xxtwotankunc.png")

% Figure 5: Schematic representation of a perturbed, linear two-tank system.

% To complete the uncertainty model, we quantify how big the modeling errors are as a function of frequency.
% While it's difficult to determine precisely the amount of uncertainty in a system, we can look for rough bounds based on the frequency ranges where the linear model is accurate or poor, as in these cases:
% - The nominal model for h1 is very accurate up to at least 0.3 Hz.
% - Limit-cycle experiments in the t1 loop suggest that uncertainty should dominate above 0.02 Hz.
% - There are about 180 degrees of additional phase lag in the t1 model at about 0.02 Hz. There is also a significant gain loss at this frequency. These effects result from the unmodeled mixing dynamics.
% - Limit cycle experiments in the t2 loop suggest that uncertainty should dominate above 0.03 Hz.

% This data suggests the following choices for the frequency-dependent modeling error bounds.
Wh1 = 0.01+tf([0.5,0],[0.25,1]);
Wt1 = 0.1+tf([20*h1ss,0],[0.2,1]);
Wt2 = 0.1+tf([100,0],[1,21]);

%%% Setting up a Controller Design
% Now let's look at the control design problem.
% We're interested in tracking setpoint commands for t1 and t2.
% To take advantage of H-infinity design algorithms, we must formulate the design as a closed-loop gain minimization problem.
% To do so, we select weighting functions that capture the disturbance characteristics and performance requirements to help normalize the corresponding frequency-dependent gain constraints.

% Here is a suitable weighted open-loop transfer function for the two-tank problem:

figure
imshow("xxtwotankicdesign.png")
axis off;

% Figure 8: Control design interconnection for two-tank system.

% Next, we select weights for the sensor noises, setpoint commands, tracking errors, and hot/cold actuators.
% The sensor dynamics are insignificant relative to the dynamics of the rest of the system.
% This is not true of the sensor noise.
% Potential sources of noise include electronic noise in thermocouple compensators, amplifiers, and filters, radiated noise from the stirrers, and poor grounding.
% We use smoothed FFT analysis to estimate the noise level, which suggests the following weights:
Wh1noise = zpk(0.01);  % h1 noise weight
Wt1noise = zpk(0.03);  % t1 noise weight
Wt2noise = zpk(0.03);  % t2 noise weight

% The error weights penalize setpoint tracking errors on t1 and t2.
% We'll pick first-order low-pass filters for these weights.
% We use a higher weight (better tracking) for t1 because physical considerations lead us to believe that t1 is easier to control than t2.
Wt1perf = tf(100,[400,1]);	% t1 tracking error weight
Wt2perf = tf(50,[800,1]);	% t2 tracking error weight

figure
bodemag(Wt1perf,Wt2perf)
title('Frequency-dependent penalty on setpoint tracking errors')
legend('t1','t2')

% Figure 9: Frequency-dependent penalty on setpoint tracking errors.

% The reference (setpoint) weights reflect the frequency contents of such commands.
% Because the majority of the water flowing into tank 2 comes from tank 1, changes in t2 are dominated by changes in t1.
% Also t2 is normally commanded to a value close to t1.
% So it makes more sense to use setpoint weighting expressed in terms of t1 and t2-t1:

%  t1cmd = Wt1cmd * w1
%  t2cmd = Wt1cmd * w1 + Wtdiffcmd * w2

% where w1, w2 are white noise inputs.
% Adequate weight choices are:
Wt1cmd = zpk(0.1);               % t1 input command weight
Wtdiffcmd = zpk(0.01);           % t2 - t1  input command weight

% Finally, we would like to penalize both the amplitude and the rate of the actuator.
% We do this by weighting fhc (and fcc) with a function that rolls up at high frequencies.
% Alternatively, we can create an actuator model with fh and d|fh|/dt as outputs, and weight each output separately with constant weights.
% This approach has the advantage of reducing the number of states in the weighted open-loop model.
Whact =  zpk(0.01);  % Hot actuator penalty
Wcact =  zpk(0.01);  % Cold actuator penalty

Whrate = zpk(50);    % Hot actuator rate penalty
Wcrate = zpk(50);    % Cold actuator rate penalty

%%% Building a Weighted Open-Loop Model
% Now that we have modeled all plant components and selected our design weights, we'll use the connect function to build an uncertain model of the weighted open-loop model shown in Figure 8.

%%% H-infinity Controller Design
% By constructing the weights and weighted open loop of Figure 8, we have recast the control problem as a closed-loop gain minimization.

% The smallest achievable closed-loop gain is about 0.9, which shows us that our frequency-domain tracking performance specifications are met by the controller k0.
% Simulating this design in the time domain is a reasonable way to check that we have correctly set the performance weights.
% First, we create a closed-loop model mapping the input signals [ t1ref; t2ref; t1noise; t2noise] to the output signals [ h1; t1; t2; fhc; fcc]:
