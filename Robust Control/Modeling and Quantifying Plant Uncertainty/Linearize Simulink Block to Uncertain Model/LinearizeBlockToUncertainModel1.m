%% Linearize Simulink Block to Uncertain Model
% This example shows how to make a SimulinkÂ® block linearize to an uncertain variable at the command line.
% To learn how to specify an uncertain block linearization using the Simulink model editor, see Specify Uncertain Linearization for Core or Custom Simulink Blocks.

% For this example, open the Simulink model slexAircraftExample.
mdl = 'slexAircraftExample';
open_system(mdl)

figure
imshow("LinearizeBlockToUncertainModelExample_01.png")
axis off;

% Examine the subsystem Aircraft Dynamics Model.
subsys = [mdl,'/Aircraft Dynamics Model'];
open_system(subsys)

% Suppose you want to specify the following uncertain real values for the gain blocks Mw and Zd.
Mw_unc = ureal('Mw',-0.00592,'Percentage',50);
Zd_unc = ureal('Zd',-63.9979,'Percentage',30);

% To specify these values as the linearization for these blocks, create a BlockSubs structure to pass to the linearize function.
% The field names are the names of the Simulink blocks, and the values are the corresponding uncertain values.
% Note that in this model, the name of the Mw block is Gain4, and the name of the Zd block is Gain5.
Mw_name = [subsys,'/Gain4'];
Zd_name = [subsys,'/Gain5'];

BlockSubs(1).Name = Mw_name;
BlockSubs(1).Value = Mw_unc;
BlockSubs(2).Name = Zd_name;
BlockSubs(2).Value = Zd_unc;

% Compute the uncertain linearization.
% linearize linearizes the model at operating point specified in the model, making the substitutions specified by BlockSubs.
% The result is an uncertain state-space model with an uncertain real parameter for each of the two uncertain gains.
sys = linearize(mdl,BlockSubs)

% Examine the uncertain model response.
figure
step(sys)

% step takes random samples and provides a sense of the range of responses within the uncertainty of the linearized model.
