%% Create Uncertain Frequency Response Data Models
% Uncertain frequency responses (ufrd) arise naturally when computing the frequency response of an uncertain state-space model (uss).
% They also arise when frequency response data in an frd model object is combined with an uncertain matrix (umat) such as by adding, multiplying, or concatenating.

% To take the frequency response of an uncertain state-space model, use the ufrd command.
% Construct an uncertain state-space model.
p1 = ureal('p1',10,'pe',50); 
p2 = ureal('p2',3,'plusm',[-.5 1.2]); 
p3 = ureal('p3',0); 
A = [-p1 p2;0 -p1]; 
B = [-p2;p2+p3]; 
C = [1 0;1 1-p3]; 
D = [0;0]; 
sys = ss(A,B,C,D) 

% Compute the uncertain frequency response of the uncertain system.
% Use ufrd command with a frequency grid of 100 points.
% The result is an uncertain frequency response model object, a ufrd model.
sysg = ufrd(sys,logspace(-2,2,100))  

%%% Properties of ufrd Model Objects
% View the properties of the model object.
get(sysg)

% The properties ResponseData and Frequency behave the same as the corresponding properties in Control System Toolboxâ„¢ frd objects, except that ResponseData is an uncertain matrix (umat).
% The properties InputName, OutputName, InputGroup, and OutputGroup behave in exactly the same manner as for all of the Control System Toolbox model objects such as ss, zpk, tf, and frd.

% The NominalValue property is an frd object.
% Hence all functions you can use to analyze frd objects can also analyze ufrd objects. are available.
% When you use analysis commands such as bode or step with an uncertain model, the command plots random samples of the response to give you a sense of the variation.
% For instance, plot sampled Bode responses of the system along with the nominal response, using a dot marker so that you can see the individual frequency points.

bode(sysg,'r.',sysg.NominalValue,'b.')

% Just as with umat uncertain matrices and uss uncertain models, the Uncertainty property of the ufrd model is a structure containing the uncertain elements.
% In the model sysg, all uncertain elements are ureal parameters.
% Change the nominal value of the uncertain element p1 within sysg to 14, and plot the Bode response of the (new) nominal system.
sysg.Uncertainty.p1.NominalValue = 14

bode(sysg.NominalValue)

%%% Lifting an frd model to a ufrd model
% A non-uncertain frequency response model is equivalent to an uncertain frequency response model with no uncertain elements.
% Use the ufrd command to "lift" an frd model to the ufrd class.
sys = rss(3,2,1); 
sysg = frd(sys,logspace(-2,2,100)); 
usysg = ufrd(sysg) 

% You can also lift arrays of frd objects.
% See Array Management for Uncertain Objects for more information about how arrays of uncertain objects are handled.
