%% Modeling a Family of Responses as an Uncertain System
% This example shows how to use the Robust Control Toolboxâ„¢ command ucover to model a family of LTI responses as an uncertain system.
% This command is useful to fit an uncertain model to a set of frequency responses representative of the system variability, or to reduce the complexity of an existing uncertain model to facilitate the synthesis of robust controllers with musyn.

%%% Modeling Plant Variability as Uncertainty
% In this first example, we have a family of models describing the plant behavior under various operating conditions.
% The nominal plant model is a first-order unstable system.
Pnom = tf(2,[1 -2])

% The other models are variations of Pnom.
% They all have a single unstable pole but the location of this pole may vary with the operating condition.
p1 = Pnom*tf(1,[.06 1]);              % extra lag
p2 = Pnom*tf([-.02 1],[.02 1]);       % time delay
p3 = Pnom*tf(50^2,[1 2*.1*50 50^2]);  % high frequency resonance
p4 = Pnom*tf(70^2,[1 2*.2*70 70^2]);  % high frequency resonance
p5 = tf(2.4,[1 -2.2]);                % pole/gain migration
p6 = tf(1.6,[1 -1.8]);                % pole/gain migration

% To apply robust control tools, we can replace this set of models with a single uncertain plant model whose range of behaviors includes p1 through p6.
% This is one use of the command ucover.
% This command takes an array of LTI models Parray and a nominal model Pnom and models the difference Parray-Pnom as multiplicative uncertainty in the system dynamics.

% Because ucover expects an array of models, use the stack command to gather the plant models p1 through p6 into one array.
Parray = stack(1,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6);

% Next, use ucover to "cover" the range of behaviors Parray with an uncertain model of the form
%P = Pnom * (1 + Wt * Delta)

% where all uncertainty is concentrated in the "unmodeled dynamics" Delta (a ultidyn object).
% Because the gain of Delta is uniformly bounded by 1 at all frequencies, a "shaping" filter Wt is used to capture how the relative amount of uncertainty varies with frequency.
% This filter is also referred to as the uncertainty weighting function.

% Try a 4th-order filter Wt for this example:
orderWt = 4;
Parrayg = frd(Parray,logspace(-1,3,60));
[P,Info] = ucover(Parrayg,Pnom,orderWt,'InputMult');

% The resulting model P is a single-input, single-output uncertain state-space (USS) object with nominal value Pnom.
P

tf(P.NominalValue)

% A Bode magnitude plot confirms that the shaping filter Wt "covers" the relative variation in plant behavior.
% As a function of frequency, the uncertainty level is 30% at 5 rad/sec (-10dB = 0.3) , 50% at 10 rad/sec, and 100% beyond 29 rad/sec.

% You can now use the uncertain model P to design a robust controller for the original family of plant models, see Simultaneous Stabilization Using Robust Control for details.

%%% Simplifying an Existing Uncertain Model
% In this second example, we start with a detailed uncertain model of the plant.
% This model consists of first-order dynamics with uncertain gain and time constant, in series with a mildly underdamped resonance and significant unmodeled dynamics.
% This model is created using the ureal and ultidyn commands for specifying uncertain variables:
gamma = ureal('gamma',2,'Perc',30);  % uncertain gain
tau = ureal('tau',1,'Perc',30);      % uncertain time-constant
wn = 50; xi = 0.25;
P = tf(gamma,[tau 1]) * tf(wn^2,[1 2*xi*wn wn^2]);

% Add unmodeled dynamics and set SampleStateDim to 5 to get representative
% sample values of the uncertain model P
delta = ultidyn('delta',[1 1],'SampleStateDim',5,'Bound',1);
W = makeweight(0.1,20,10);
P = P * (1+W*delta)

% A collection of step responses illustrates the plant variability.

title('Sampled Step Responses of Uncertain System')

% The uncertain plant model P contains 3 uncertain elements.
% For control design purposes, it is often desirable to simplify this uncertainty model while approximately retaining its overall variability.
% This is another use of the command ucover.

% To use ucover in this context, first map the uncertain model P into an array of LTI models using usample.
% This command samples the uncertain elements in an uncertain system and returns the corresponding LTI models, each model representing one possible behavior of the uncertain system.
% In this example, sample P at 60 points (the random number generator is seeded for repeatability):
rng(0,'twister');
Parray = usample(P,60);

% Next, use ucover to cover all behaviors in Parray by a simple uncertainty model Usys.
% Choose the nominal value of P as center of the cover, and use a 2nd-order filter to model the frequency distribution of the unmodeled dynamics.
orderWt = 2;
Parrayg = frd(Parray,logspace(-3,3,60));
[Usys,Info] = ucover(Parrayg,P.NominalValue,orderWt,'InputMult');

% A Bode magnitude plot shows how the filter magnitude (in red) "covers" the relative variability of the plant frequency response (in blue).

% You can now use the simplified uncertainty model Usys to design a robust controller for the original plant, see First-Cut Robust Design for details.

%%% Adjusting the Uncertainty Weighting
% In this third example, we start with 40 frequency responses of a 2-input, 2-output system.
% This data has been collected with a frequency analyzer under various operating conditions.
% A two-state nominal model is fitted to the most typical response:
A = [-5 10;-10 -5];
B = [1 0;0 1];
C = [1 10;-10 1];
D = 0;
Pnom = ss(A,B,C,D);

% The frequency response data is loaded into a 40-by-1 array of FRD models:
load ucover_demo
size(Pdata)

% Plot this data and superimpose the nominal model.

legend('Frequency response data','Nominal model','Location','NorthEast')

% Because the response variability is modest, try modeling this family of frequency responses using an additive uncertainty model of the form
%P = Pnom + w * Delta

% where Delta is a 2-by-2 ultidyn object representing the unmodeled dynamics and w is a scalar weighting function reflecting the frequency distribution of the uncertainty (variability in Pdata).

% Start with a first-order filter w and compare the magnitude of w with the minimum amount of uncertainty needed at each frequency:
figure
[P1,InfoS1] = ucover(Pdata,Pnom,1,'Additive');
w = InfoS1.W1;
bodemag(w,'r',InfoS1.W1opt,'g',{1e-1 1e3})
title('Scalar Additive Uncertainty Model')
legend('First-order w','Min. uncertainty amount','Location','SouthWest')

% The magnitude of w should closely match the minimum uncertainty amount.
% It is clear that the first-order fit is too conservative and exceeds this minimum amount at most frequencies.
% Try again with a third-order filter w.
% For speed, reuse the data in InfoS1 to avoid recomputing the optimal uncertainty scaling at each frequency.
figure
[P3,InfoS3] = ucover(Pnom,InfoS1,3,'Additive');
w = InfoS3.W1;
bodemag(w,'r',InfoS3.W1opt,'g',{1e-1 1e3})
title('Scalar Additive Uncertainty Model')
legend('Third-order w','Min. uncertainty amount','Location','SouthWest')

% The magnitude of w now closely matches the minimum uncertainty amount.
% Among additive uncertainty models, P3 provides a tight cover of the behaviors in Pdata.
% Note that P3 has a total of 8 states (2 from the nominal part and 6 from w).
P3

% You can refine this additive uncertainty model by using non-scalar uncertainty weighting functions, for example
%P = Pnom + W1*Delta*W2

% where W1 and W2 are 2-by-2 diagonal filters.
% In this example, restrict use W2=1 and allow both diagonal entries of W1 to be third order.
[PM,InfoM] = ucover(Pdata,Pnom,[3;3],[],'Additive');

% Compare the two entries of W1 with the minimum uncertainty amount computed earlier.
% Note that at all frequencies, one of the diagonal entries of W1 has magnitude much smaller than the scalar filter w.
% This suggests that the diagonally-weighted uncertainty model yields a less conservative cover of the frequency response family.

% The degree of conservativeness of one cover over another can be partially quantified by considering the two frequency-dependent quantities:
% Fd2s = norm(inv(W1)*w) ,   Fs2d = norm(W1/w)

% These quantities measure by how much one uncertainty model needs to be scaled to cover the other.
% For example, the uncertainty model Pnom + W1*Delta needs to be enlarged by a factor Fd2s to include all of the models represented by the uncertain model Pnom + w*Delta.

% Plot Fd2s and Fs2d as a function of frequency.

% This plot shows that:
% - Fs2d = 1 in a large frequency range so Pnom+w*Delta includes all the behaviors modeled by Pnom+W1*Delta
% - In that same frequency range, Pnom+W1*Delta does not include all of the behaviors modeled by Pnom+w*Delta and, in fact, would need to be enlarged by a factor between 1.2 and 2.6 in order to do so.
% - In the frequency range [1 20], neither uncertainty model contains the other, but at all frequencies, making Pnom+W1*Delta cover Pnom+w*Delta requires a much smaller scaling factor than the converse.

% This indicates that the Pnom+W1*Delta model provides a less conservative cover of the frequency response data in Pdata.
