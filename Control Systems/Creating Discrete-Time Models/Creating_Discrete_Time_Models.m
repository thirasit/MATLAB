%% Creating Discrete-Time Models
% This example shows how to create discrete-time linear models using the tf, zpk, ss, and frd commands.

%%% Specifying Discrete-Time Models
% Control System Toolboxâ„¢ lets you create both continuous-time and discrete-time models.
% The syntax for creating discrete-time models is similar to that for continuous-time models, except that you must also provide a sample time (sampling interval in seconds).
% For example, to specify the discrete-time transfer function:
figure
imshow("CreatingDiscrete-TimeModels_01.png")

% with sampling period Ts = 0.1 s, type:
num = [ 1  -1 ];
den = [ 1  -1.85  0.9 ];
H = tf(num,den,0.1)

% or equivalently:
z = tf('z',0.1);
H = (z - 1) / (z^2 - 1.85*z + 0.9);

% Similarly, to specify the discrete-time state-space model:
figure
imshow("CreatingDiscrete-TimeModels_02.png")

% with sampling period Ts = 0.1 s, type:
sys = ss(.5,1,.2,0,0.1);

%%% Recognizing Discrete-Time Systems
% There are several ways to determine if your LTI model is discrete:
% - The display shows a nonzero sample time value
% - sys.Ts or get(sys,'Ts') return a nonzero sample time value.
% - isdt(sys) returns true.
% For example, for the transfer function H specified above,
H.Ts
isdt(H)

% You can also spot discrete-time systems by looking for the following traits:
% - Time response plots - Response curve has a staircase look owing to its sampled-data nature
% - Bode plots - There is a vertical bar marking the Nyquist frequency (pi divided by the sample time).
% The following plots show these characteristic traits:
