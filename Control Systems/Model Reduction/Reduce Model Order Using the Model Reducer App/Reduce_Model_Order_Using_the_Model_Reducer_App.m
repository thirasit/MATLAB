%% Reduce Model Order Using the Model Reducer App

% This example shows how to reduce model order while preserving important dynamics using the Model Reducer app. 
% This example illustrates the Balanced Truncation method, which eliminates states based on their energy contributions to the system response.

%%% Open Model Reducer with a Building Model

% This example uses a model of the Los Angeles University Hospital building. 
% The building has eight floors, each with three degrees of freedom: two displacements and one rotation.
% The input-output relationship for any one of these displacements is represented as a 48-state model, 
% where each state represents a displacement or its rate of change (velocity). 
% Load the building model and open Model Reducer with that model.

load building.mat
modelReducer(G)

% Select the model in the Data Browser to display some information about the model in the Preview section. 
% Double-click the model to see more detailed information.

%%% Open the Balanced Truncation Tab

% Model Reducer has three model reduction methods: Balanced Truncation, Mode Selection, and Pole/Zero Simplification. 
% For this example, click Balanced Truncation.

% Model Reducer opens the Balanced Truncation tab and automatically generates a reduced-order model. 
% The top plot compares the original and reduced model in the frequency domain. 
% The bottom plot shows the energy contribution of each state, 
% where the states are sorted from high energy to low energy. 
% The order of the reduced model, 14, is highlighted in the bar chart. 
% In the reduced model, all states with lower energy contribution than this one are discarded.

%%% Compute Multiple Approximations

% Suppose that you want to preserve the first, second, and third peaks of the model response, 
% around 5.2 rad/s, 13 rad/s, and 25 rad/s. 
% Try other model orders to see whether you can achieve this goal with a lower model order. 
% Compute a 5th-order and a 10th-order approximation in one of the following ways:

% - In the Reduced model orders text box, enter [5 10].
% - In the state-contribution plot, ctrl-click the bars for state 5 and state 10.

% Model Reducer computes two new reduced-order models and displays them on the response plot with the original model G. 
% To examine the three peaks more closely, Zoom in on the relevant frequency range. 
% The 10th-order model captures the three peaks successfully, while the 5th-order model only approximates the first two peaks. 
% (For information about zooming and other interactions with the analysis plots, see Visualize Reduced-Order Models in the Model Reducer App.)

%%% Compare Reduced Models with Different Visualizations

% In addition to the frequency response plot of all three models, Model Reducer lets you examine the absolute and relative error between the original and reduced models. 
% Select Absolute error plot to see the difference between the building and reduced models.

figure
imshow("ReduceModelOrderUsingModelReducerExample_04.png")

% The 5th-order reduced model has at most -60dB error in the frequency region of the first two peaks, below about 30 rad/s. 
% The error increases at higher frequencies. 
% The 10th-order reduced model has smaller error over all frequencies.

%%% Create Reduced Models in Data Browser

% Store the reduced models in the Data Browser by clicking Create Reduced Model. 
% The 5th-order and 10th-order reduced models appear in the Data Browser with names GReduced5 and Greduced10.

figure
imshow("ReduceModelOrderUsingModelReducerExample_05.png")

% You can continue to change the model-reduction parameters and generate additional reduced models. 
% As you do so, GReduced5 and Greduced10 remain unchanged in the Data Browser.

%%% Focus on Dynamics at Particular Frequencies

% By default, balanced truncation in Model Reducer preserves DC gain, matching the steady-state response of the original and reduced models. 
% Clear the Preserve DC Gain checkbox to better approximate high-frequency dynamics. Model Reducer computes new reduced models. 
% The error in the high-frequency region is decreased at the cost of a slight increase in error at low frequencies.

figure
imshow("ReduceModelOrderUsingModelReducerExample_06.png")

% You can also focus the balanced truncation on the model dynamics in a particular frequency interval. 
% For example, approximate only the second peak of the building model around 13 rad/s. 
% First, select the Model response plot to see the Bode plots of models. 
% Then check Select frequency range checkbox. 
% Model Reducer analyzes state contributions in the highlighted frequency interval only.

% You can drag the boundaries to change the frequency range interactively. 
% As you change the frequency interval, 
% the Hankel Singular Value plot reflects the changes in the energy contributions of the states.

% Enter the frequency limits [10 22] into the text box next to Focus on range. 
% The 5th-order reduced model captures the essential dynamics. 
% The 10th-order model has almost the same dynamics as the original building model within this frequency range.

% Optionally, store these additional models in the Data Browser by clicking Create Reduced Model.

%%% Compare Models in Time Domain

% You can compare time-domain responses of the stored reduced models and the original in the Plots tab. 
% In the Data Browser, control-click to select the models you want to compare, G, GReduced5, and GReduced10. 
% Then, click Step. 
% Model Reducer creates a step plot with all three models.

% Zooming on the transient behavior of this plot shows that GReduced10 captures the time domain behavior of the original model well. 
% However, the response of GReduced5 deviates from the original model after about 3 seconds.

%%% Export Model for Further Analysis

% Comparison of the reduced and original models in the time and frequency domains shows that GReduced10 adequately captures the dynamics of interest. 
% Export that model to the MATLABÂ® workspace for further analysis and design. 
% In the Model Reducer tab, click Export Model. 
% Clear the check boxes for G and Greduced5, and click Export to export Greduced10.

% Greduced10 appears in the MATLAB workspace as a state-space (ss) model.
