%%% Continuous/Discrete Conversion
% For example, consider the second-order system with delay:

figure
imshow("resampledemo_eq15061525669404418842.png")

% To compute its zero-order hold (ZOH) discretization with sampling rate of 10 Hz, type

G = tf([1 -2],[1 3 20],'inputdelay',1);
Ts = 0.1;   % sampling interval
Gd = c2d(G,Ts)

% Compare the continuous and discrete step responses:

figure
step(G,'b',Gd,'r')
legend('Continuous','Discretized')

%%% Discrete/Continuous Conversion
% Conversely, you can use d2c to compute a continuous-time "interpolant" for a given discrete-time system. 
% Starting with the discretization Gd computed above, convert it back to continuous and compare with the original model G:

figure
Gc = d2c(Gd);
step(G,'b',Gd,'r',Gc,'g--')
legend('Original','Discretized','D2C Interpolant')

% The two continuous-time responses match perfectly. 
% You may not always obtain a perfect match especially when your sampling interval Ts is too large and aliasing occurs during discretization:

figure
Ts = 1;  % 10 times larger than previously
Hd = c2d(G,Ts);
Hc = d2c(Hd);
step(G,'b',Hd,'r',Hc,'g--',10)
legend('Original','Discretized','D2C Interpolant')

%%% Resampling of Discrete-Time Systems
% Resampling consists of changing the sampling interval of a discrete-time system. 
% This operation is performed with d2d. 
% For example, consider the 10 Hz discretization Gd of our original continuous-time model G. 
% You can resample it at 40 Hz using:

Gr = d2d(Gd,0.025)

% Compare this with a direct discretization at 40 Hz:

figure
step(G,'b',Gr,'r',c2d(G,0.025),'g--',4)
legend('Continuous','Resampled from 0.1 to 0.025','Discretized with Ts=0.025')

% Notice that both approaches lead to the same answer.
