%% Discretizing a Notch Filter
% This example shows the comparison of several techniques for discretizing a notch filter. 
% While control system components are often designed in continuous time, 
% they must generally be discretized for implementation on digital computers and embedded processors.

%%% Continuous-Time Notch Filter
% Notch filters are designed to reject signal content at a specific frequency by sharply attenuating the gain at that frequency. 
% For this example we consider the following notch filter:

figure
imshow("DiscretizingANotchFilter_01.png")

% You can plot the frequency response of this filter with the bode command:

figure
H = tf([1 0.5 100],[1 5 100]);
bode(H), grid

% This notch filter provides a 20dB attenuation at the frequency w = 10 rad/s.

%%% Choosing the Discretization Method
% You can discretize a continuous-time system with the c2d command. 
% Several discretization algorithms are supported by Control System Toolboxâ„¢, including:
% - Zero-order hold
% - First-order hold
% - Impulse invariant
% - Tustin (bilinear approximation)
% - Tustin with frequency prewarping
% - Matched poles and zeros

% Which method to choose depends on the application and requirements.
% The zero- and first-order hold methods and the impulse-invariant method are well-suited for discrete approximations in the time domain. 
% For example, the step response of the ZOH discretization matches the continuous-time step response at each time step (independently of the sampling rate):

figure
Ts = 0.1;
Hdz = c2d(H,Ts,'zoh');
step(H,'b',Hdz,'r'),
legend('Continuous','Discretized at 10 Hz')

% Similarly, the impulse-invariant discretization has the same impulse response as the original system:

figure
G = tf([1 -3],[1 2 10]);
Gd = c2d(G,Ts,'imp');
impulse(G,'b',Gd,'r')
legend('Continuous','Discretized at 10 Hz')

% By contrast, the Tustin and Matched methods tend to perform better in the frequency domain because they introduce less gain and phase distortion near the Nyquist frequency. 
% For example, compare the Bode responses of the continuous-time notch filter and its discretizations using the ZOH, Tustin, and Matched algorithms:

figure
Hdt = c2d(H,Ts,'tustin');
Hdm = c2d(H,Ts,'match');
bode(H,'b',Hdz,'r',Hdt,'m',Hdm,'g',{1 100}), grid
legend('Continuous','ZOH','Tustin','Matched')

% This comparison indicates that the Matched method provides the most accurate frequency-domain approximation of the notch filter. 
% However, you can further improve the accuracy of the Tustin algorithm by specifying a prewarping frequency equal to the notch frequency. 
% This ensures accurate match near w = 10 rad/s:

figure
Hdp = c2d(H,Ts,'prewarp',10);
bode(H,'b',Hdt,'m',Hdp,'g',{1 100}), grid
legend('Continuous','Tustin','Tustin with prewarping')

%%% Choosing the Sampling Rate
% The higher the sampling rate, the closer the match between the continuous and discretized responses. 
% But how small can the sampling rate be, or equivalently, how large can the sampling interval be? As a rule of thumb, 
% if you want the continuous and discretized models to match closely up to some frequency wm, 
% make sure that the Nyquist frequency (sampling rate times Pi) is at least twice wm. 
% For the notch filter, you need to preserve the shape near 10 rad/s, so the Nyquist frequency should be beyond 20 rad/s, 
% which gives a sampling period of at most pi/20 = 0.16 s.

% To confirm this choice, compare the matched discretizations with sampling period 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3:

figure
Hd1 = c2d(H,0.1,'m');
Hd2 = c2d(H,0.15,'m');
Hd3 = c2d(H,0.3,'m');
bode(H,'b',Hd1,'r',Hd2,'m',Hd3,'g',{1 100}), grid
legend('Continuous','Ts = 0.1','Ts = 0.15','Ts = 0.3')

% As predicted, the discretization remains fairly accurate for Ts < 0.16 but starts breaking down for larger sampling intervals.
