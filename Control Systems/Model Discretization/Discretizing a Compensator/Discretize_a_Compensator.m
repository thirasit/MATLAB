%% Discretize a Compensator
% This example shows how to convert a compensator from continuous to discrete time using several discretization methods, 
% to identify a method that yields a good match in the frequency domain.

% You might design a compensator in continuous time, and then need to convert it to discrete time for a digital implementation. 
% When you do so, you want the discretization to preserve frequency-domain characteristics that are essential to your performance and stability requirements.

% In the following control system, G is a continuous-time second-order system with a sharp resonance around 3 rad/s.

% One valid controller for this system includes a notch filter in series with an integrator. 
% Create a model of this controller.

figure
notch = tf([1,0.5,9],[1,5,9]);
integ = pid(0,0.34);
C = integ*notch;
bodeplot(C)

% The notch filter centered at 3 rad/s counteracts the effect of the resonance in G. 
% This configuration allows higher loop gain for a faster overall response.

% Discretize the compensator.

Cdz = c2d(C,0.5);

% The c2d command supports several different discretization methods. 
% Since this command does not specify a method, c2d uses the default method, Zero-Order Hold (ZOH). 
% In the ZOH method, the time-domain response of the discretized compensator matches the continuous-time response at each time step.

% The discretized controller Cdz has a sample time of 0.5 s. 
% In practice, the sample time you choose might be constrained by the system in which you implement your controller, 
% or by the bandwidth of your control system.

% Compare the frequency-domain response of C and Cdz.

bodeplot(C,Cdz)
legend('C','Cdz');

% The vertical line marks the Nyquist frequency, Ï€/T_s, where T_s is the sample time. 
% Near the Nyquist frequency, the response of the discretized compensator is distorted relative to the continuous-time response. 
% As a result, the discretized notched filter may not properly counteract the plant resonance.

% To fix this, try discretizing the compensator using the Tustin method and compare to the ZOH result. 
% The Tustin discretization method often yields a better match in the frequency domain than the ZOH method.

figure
Cdt = c2d(C,0.5,'tustin');
plotopts = bodeoptions;
plotopts.Ylim = {[-60,40],[-225,0]};
bodeplot(C,Cdz,Cdt,plotopts)
legend('C','Cdz','Cdt')

% The Tustin method preserves the depth of the notch. 
% However, the method introduces a frequency shift that is unacceptable for many applications. 
% You can remedy the frequency shift by specifying the notch frequency as the prewarping frequency in the Tustin transform.

% Discretize the compensator using the Tustin method with frequency prewarping, and compare the results.

figure
discopts = c2dOptions('Method','tustin','PrewarpFrequency',3.0);
Cdtp = c2d(C,0.5,discopts);
bodeplot(C,Cdt,Cdtp,plotopts)
legend('C','Cdt','Cdtp')

% To specify additional discretization options beyond the discretization method, use c2dOptions. 
% Here, the discretization options set discopts specifies both the Tustin method and the prewarp frequency. 
% The prewarp frequency is 3.0 rad/s, the frequency of the notch in the compensator response.

% Using the Tustin method with frequency prewarping yields a better-matching frequency response than Tustin without prewarping.
