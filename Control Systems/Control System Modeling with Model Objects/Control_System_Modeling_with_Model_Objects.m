%% Control System Modeling with Model Objects
% Model objects can represent individual components of a control architecture, such as the plant, actuators, sensors, or controllers. 
% You can connect model objects to build aggregate models of block diagrams that represent the combined response of multiple elements.

% For example, the following control system contains a prefilter F, a plant G, and a controller C, arranged in a single-loop configuration. 
% The model also includes a representation of sensor dynamics, S.

% You can represent each of the components as a model object. 
% You do not need to use the same type of model object for each component. 
% For example, represent the plant G as a zero-pole-gain (zpk) model with a double pole at s = -1; C as a PID controller, and F and S as transfer functions:

G = zpk([],[-1,-1],1);
C = pid(2,1.3,0.3,0.5);
S = tf(5,[1 4]);
F = tf(1,[1 1]);

% You can then combine these elements build models that represent your control system or the control system as a whole. 
% For example, create the open-loop response SGC:

open_loop = S*G*C;

% To build a model of the unfiltered closed-loop response, use the feedback command:
T = feedback(G*C,S);

% To model the entire closed-loop system response from r to y, combine T with the filter transfer function:
Try = T*F;

% The results open_loop, T, and Try are also linear model objects. 
% You can operate on them with Control System Toolboxâ„¢ control design and analysis commands. 
% For example, plot the step response of the entire system:

stepplot(Try)

% When you combine Numeric LTI models, the resulting Numeric LTI model represents the aggregate system. 
% The resulting model does not retain the original data from the combined components. 
% For example, T does not separately keep track of the dynamics of the components G, C, and S that are combined to create T.
