%% Tune a Control System Using Control System Tuner

% This example shows how to use the Control System Tuner app to tune a MIMO, multiloop control system modeled in SimulinkÂ®.
% Control System Tuner lets you model any control architecture and specify the structure of controller components, such as PID controllers, gains, and other elements. 
% You specify which blocks in the model are tunable. 
% Control System Tuner parameterizes those blocks and tunes the free parameters system to meet design requirements that you specify, such as setpoint tracking, disturbance rejection, and stability margins.

%%% Control System Model

% This example uses the Simulink model rct_helico. 
% Open the model.

open_system('rct_helico')

imshow("ControlSystemTuner_HelicopterExample_01.png")

% The plant, Helicopter, is an 8-state helicopter model trimmed to a steady-state hovering condition. 
% The state vector x = [u,w,q,theta,v,p,phi,r] consists of:
% - Longitudinal velocity u (m/s)
% - Normal velocity w (m/s)
% - Pitch rate q (deg/s)
% - Pitch angle theta (deg)
% - Lateral velocity v (m/s)
% - Roll rate p (deg/s)
% - Roll angle phi (deg)
% - Yaw rate r (deg/s)

% The control system of the model has two feedback loops. 
% The inner loop provides static output feedback for stability augmentation and decoupling, represented in the model by the gain block SOF. 
% The outer loop has a PI controller for each of the three attitude angles. 
% The controller generates commands ds,dc,dT in degrees for the longitudinal cyclic, lateral cyclic, and tail rotor collective using measurements of theta, phi, p, q, and r. 
% This loop provides the desired setpoint tracking for the three angles.

% This example uses these control objectives:
% - Track setpoint changes in theta, phi, and r with zero steady-state error, rise times of about 2 seconds, minimal overshoot, and minimal cross-coupling.
% - Limit the control bandwidth to guard against neglected high-frequency rotor dynamics and measurement noise. (The model contains low-pass filters that partially enforce this objective.)
% - Provide strong multivariable gain and phase margins. (Multivariable margins measure robustness to simultaneous gain or phase variations at the plant inputs and outputs. See the diskmargin reference page for details.)

%%% Set Up the Model for Tuning
% Using Control System Tuner, you can jointly tune the inner and outer loops to meet all the design requirements. 
% To set up the model for tuning, open the app and specify which blocks of the Simulink model you want to tune.

% In the Simulink model window, under Control Systems in the Apps tab, select Control System Tuner.

% In Control System Tuner, on the Tuning tab, click Select Blocks. 
% Use the Select tuned blocks dialog box to specify the blocks to tune.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI3.png")

% Click Add Blocks. 
% Control System Tuner analyzes your model to find blocks that can be tuned. 
% For this example, the controller blocks to tune are the three PI controllers and the gain block. 
% Check the corresponding blocks PI1, PI2, PI3, and SOF.

imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI4.png")

% Click OK. 
% The Select tuned blocks dialog box now reflects the blocks you added.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI5.png")

% When you select a block to tune, Control System Tuner automatically parameterizes the block according to its type and initializes the parameterization with the block value in the Simulink model. 
% In this example, the PI controllers are initialized to $1+1/s$ and the static output-feedback gain is initialized to zero on all channels. 
% Simulating the model shows that the control system is unstable for these initial values.

%%% Specify Tuning Goals
% The design requirements for this system, discussed previously, include setpoint tracking, minimum stability margins, and a limit on fast dynamics. 
% In Control System Tuner, you capture design requirements using tuning goals.

% First, create a tuning goal for the setpoint-tracking requirement on theta, phi, and r. 
% On the Tuning tab, in the New Goal drop-down list, select Tracking of step commands.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI7.png")

% In the Step Tracking Goal dialog, specify the reference signals for tracking. 
% Under Specify step-response inputs, click Add signal to list. 
% Then click Select signal from model.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI7a.png")

% In the Simulink model editor, select the reference signals theta_ref, phi_ref, and r_ref. 
% These signals appear in the Select signals dialog box. 
% Click Add Signal(s) to add them to the step tracking goal.

% Next, specify the outputs that you want to track those references. 
% Under Specify step-response outputs, add the outputs theta, phi, and r.

% The requirement is that the responses at the outputs track the reference commands with a first-order response that has a one-second time constant. 
% Enter these values in the Desired Response section of the dialog box. Also, for this example set Keep mismatch below to 20. 
% This value sets a 20% relative mismatch between the target first-order response and the tuned response.

% This figure shows the configuration of the Step Tracking Goal dialog box. 
% Click OK to save the tuning goal.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI8.png")

% Next, create tuning goals for the desired stability margin requirements. 
% For this example, the multivariable gain and phase margins at the plant inputs u and plant outputs y must be at least 5 dB and 40 degrees. 
% Create separate tuning goals for the input and output margin constraints. 
% In the New Goal drop-down list, select Minimum stability margins. 
% In the Margins Goal dialog box, add the input signal u under Measure stability margins at the following locations. 
% Also, enter the gain and phase values 5 and 40 in the Desired Margins section of the dialog box. 
% Click OK to save the input stability margin goal.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI9.png")

% Create another Margins Goal for the output stability margin. 
% Specify the output signal y and the target margins, as shown, and save the output stability margin goal.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI10.png")

% The last requirement is to limit fast dynamics and jerky transients. 
% To achieve this, create a tuning goal that constrains the magnitude of the closed-loop poles to less than 25 rad/s. 
% In the New Goal drop-down list, select Constraint on closed-loop dynamics. 
% In the Poles Goal dialog box, specify the maximum natural frequency of 25, and click OK to save the tuning goal.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI11.png")

% As you create each tuning goal, Control System Tuner creates a new figure that displays a graphical representation of the tuning goal. 
% When you tune your control system, you can refer to this figure for a graphical representation of how closely the tuned system satisfies the tuning goal.

%%% Tune the Control System
% Tune the control system to meet the design requirements you have specified.

% On the Tuning tab, click Tune. 
% Control System Tuner adjusts the tunable parameters to values that best meet those requirements.

% Control System Tuner automatically updates the tuning-goal plots to reflect the tuned parameter values. 
% Examine these plots to see how well the requirements are satisfied by the design. 
% For instance, examine the tuned step responses of tracking requirements.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI14.png")

% The blue line shows that the tuned response is very close to the target response, in pink. 
% The rise time is about two seconds, and there is no overshoot and little cross-coupling.

% Similarly, the MarginsGoal1 and MarginsGoal2 plots provide a visual assessment of the multivariable stability margins. 
% (See the diskmargin reference page for more information about multivariable stability margins.) 
% These plots show that the stability margin is out of the shaded region, satisfying the requirement at all frequencies.

imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI15.png")

% You can also view a numeric report of the tuning results. 
% Click the Tuning Report at the bottom right of Control System Tuner.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI13.png")

% When you tune the model, Control System Tuner converts each tuning goal to a function of the tunable parameters of the system and adjusts the parameters to minimize the value of those functions. 
% For this example, the tuning report shows that the final values for all tuning goals are close to 1, which indicates that all the requirements are nearly met.

%%% Validate the Tuned Design
% In general, your Simulink model represents a nonlinear system. 
% Control System Tuner linearizes the model at the operating point you specify in the app, and tunes parameters using the linear approximation of your system. 
% Therefore, it is important to validate the controller design on the full Simulink model.

% To do so, write the tuned parameter values back to the Simulink model. 
% On the Control System tab, click Update Blocks. 
% In the Simulink model window, simulate the model with the new parameter values. 
% Observe the response to the step changes in setpoint commands, theta-ref, phi-ref, and r-ref at 0, 3, and 6 seconds respectively.

figure
imshow("xxcontrolsystemtunerapp_helicoGUI18.png")

% Examine the simulation to confirm that you get the desired responses in the Simulink model. 
% Here, the rise time of each response is about 2 seconds with no overshoot, no steady-state error, and minimal cross-coupling, as specified in the design requirements.
