# **Time and Frequency-Domain Objectives**

Specify and visualize tuning requirements such as tracking performance, disturbance rejection, noise amplification, closed-loop pole locations, and stability margins. 
Automatically tune controller parameters to satisfy the must-have requirements (design constraints) and to best meet the remaining requirements (objectives).
