%% Nichols Plot Design

% Nichols plot design is an interactive graphical method of modifying a compensator to achieve a specific open-loop response (loop shaping). 
% Unlike Bode Diagram Design, Nichols plot design uses Nichols plots to view the open-loop frequency response. 
% Nichols plots combine gain and phase information into a single plot, which is useful when you are designing to gain and phase margin specifications. 
% You can also use the Nichols plot grid lines to estimate the closed-loop response (see ngrid). 
% For more information on Nichols plots, see nicholsplot.

%%% Tune Compensator For DC Motor Using Nichols Plot Graphical Design
% This example shows how to design a compensator for a DC motor using Nichols plot graphical tuning techniques.

%%% Plant Model and Requirements
% The transfer function of the DC motor plant, as described in SISO Example: The DC Motor, is:

figure
imshow("Opera Snapshot_2022-08-15_082317_www.mathworks.com.png")

% For this example, the design requirements are:
% - Rise time of less than 0.5 seconds
% - Steady-state error of less than 5%
% - Overshoot of less than 10%
% - Gain margin greater than 20 dB
% - Phase margin greater than 40 degrees

%%% Open Control System Designer
% At the MATLABÂ® command line, create a transfer function model of the plant, and open Control System Designer in the Nichols Editor configuration.

G = tf(1.5,[1 14 40.02]);
controlSystemDesigner('nichols',G);

% The app opens and imports G as the plant model for the default control architecture, Configuration 1.

% In the app, the following response plots open:
% - Open-loop Nichols Editor for the LoopTransfer_C response. This response is the open-loop transfer function GC, where C is the compensator and G is the plant.
% - Step Response for the IOTransfer_r2y response. This response is the input-output transfer function for the overall closed-loop system.

% To view the open-loop frequency response and closed-loop step response simultaneously, click and drag the plots to the desired location.
% The app displays the Nichols Editor and Step Response plots side-by-side

%%% Adjust Bandwidth
% Since the design requires a rise time less than 0.5 seconds, set the open-loop DC crossover frequency to about 3 rad/s. 
% To a first-order approximation, this crossover frequency corresponds to a time constant of 0.33 seconds.

% To adjust the crossover frequency increase the compensator gain. 
% In the Nichols Editor, drag the response upward. Doing so increases the gain of the compensator.

figure
imshow("csd_nichols_drag_up.png")

% As you drag the Nichols plot, the app computes the compensator gain and updates the response plots.
% Drag the Nichols plot upward until the crossover frequency is about 3 rad/s.

%%% View Step Response Characteristics
% To add the rise time to the Step Response plot, right-click the plot area, and select Characteristics > Rise Time.
% To view the rise time, move the cursor over the rise time indicator.

figure
imshow("csd_bode_editor_rise_time.png")

% The rise time is around 0.23 seconds, which satisfies the design requirements.
% Similarly, to add the peak response to the Step Response plot, right-click the plot area, and select Characteristics > Peak Response.

figure
imshow("csd_bode_editor_peak_response.png")

% The peak overshoot is around 3.5%.

%%% Add Integrator To Compensator
% To meet the 5% steady-state error requirement, eliminate steady-state error from the closed-loop step response by adding an integrator to your compensator. 
% In the Nichols Editor right-click in the plot area, and select Add Pole/Zero > Integrator.

figure
imshow("csd_nichols_integrator_added.png")

% Adding an integrator produces zero steady-state error. 
% However, changing the compensator dynamics also changes the crossover frequency, increasing the rise time. 
% To reduce the rise time, increase the crossover frequency to around 3 rad/s.

%%% Adjust Compensator Gain
% To return the crossover frequency to around 3 rad/s, increase the compensator gain further. 
% Right-click the Nichols Editor plot area, and select Edit Compensator.
% In the Compensator Editor dialog box, in the Compensator section, specify a gain of 99, and press Enter.
% The response plots update automatically.

figure
imshow("csd_nichols_set_gain.png")

% The rise time is around 0.4 seconds, which satisfies the design requirements. 
% However, the peak overshoot is around 32%. 
% A compensator consisting of a gain and an integrator is not sufficient to meet the design requirements. 
% Therefore, the compensator requires additional dynamics.

%%% Add Lead Network to Compensator
% In the Nichols Editor, review the gain margin and phase margin for the current compensator design. 
% The design requires a gain margin greater than 20 dB and phase margin greater than 40 degrees. 
% The current design does not meet either of these requirements.

% To increase the stability margins, add a lead network to the compensator.

figure
imshow("csd_nichols_gain_phase.png")

% In the Nichols Editor, right-click and select Add Pole/Zero > Lead.
% To specify the location of the lead network pole, click on the magnitude response. 
% The app adds a real pole (red X) and real zero (red O) to the compensator and to the Nichols Editor plot.
% In the Nichols Editor, drag the pole and zero to change their locations. 
% As you drag them, the app updates the pole/zero values and updates the response plots.
% To decrease the magnitude of a pole or zero, drag it towards the left. 
% Since the pole and zero are on the negative real axis, dragging them to the left moves them closer to the origin in the complex plane.

% As an initial estimate, drag the zero to a location around -7 and the pole to a location around -11.

figure
imshow("csd_nichols_lead_result1.png")

% The phase margin meets the design requirements; however, the gain margin is still too low.

%%% Edit Lead Network Pole and Zero
% To improve the controller performance, tune the lead network parameters.
% In the Compensator Editor dialog box, in the Dynamics section, click the Lead row.
% In the Edit Selected Dynamics section, in the Real Zero text box, specify a location of -4.3, and press Enter. 
% This value is near the slowest (left-most) pole of the DC motor plant.
% In the Real Pole text box, specify a value of -28, and press Enter.

figure
imshow("csd_bode_editor_edit_lead.png")

% When you modify a lead network parameters, the Compensator and response plots update automatically.
% In the app, in the Nichols Editor, the gain margin of 20.5 just meets the design requirement.
% To add robustness to the system, in the Compensator Editor dialog box, decrease the compensator gain to 84.5, and press Enter. 
% The gain margin increases to 21.8, and the response plots update.

figure
imshow("csd_nichols_lead_result2.png")

% In Control System Designer, in the response plots, compare the system performance to the design requirements. 
% The system performance characteristics are:
% - Rise time is 0.445 seconds.
% - Steady-state error is zero.
% - Overshoot is 3.39%.
% - Gain margin is 21.8 dB.
% - Phase margin is 65.6 degrees.

% The system response meets all of the design requirements.
