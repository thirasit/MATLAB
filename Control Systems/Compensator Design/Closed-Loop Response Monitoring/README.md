# **Closed-Loop Response Monitoring**

Visualize closed-loop and open-loop responses with step response, Nyquist, and other plots that dynamically update as you tune your controller. Specify and evaluate time-domain and frequency-domain design requirements such as rise time, maximum overshoot, gain margin, and phase margin.
