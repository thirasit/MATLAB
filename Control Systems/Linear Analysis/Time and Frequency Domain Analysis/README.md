# **Time and Frequency Domain Analysis**

Use the Linear System Analyzer app to view and compare time and frequency responses across multiple models using step response, impulse response, Bode, Nichols, Nyquist, singular value, and zero-pole plots. Inspect characteristics such as rise time, settling time, and maximum overshoot.
