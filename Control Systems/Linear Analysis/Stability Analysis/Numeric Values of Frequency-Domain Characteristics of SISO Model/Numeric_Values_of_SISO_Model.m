%% Numeric Values of Frequency-Domain Characteristics of SISO Model

% This example shows how to obtain numeric values of several frequency-domain characteristics of a SISO dynamic system model, 
% including the peak gain, dc gain, system bandwidth, and the frequencies at which the system gain crosses a specified frequency.

% Create a transfer function model and plot its frequency response.

figure
H = tf([10,21],[1,1.4,26]); 
bodeplot(H)

% Plotting the frequency response gives a rough idea of the frequency-domain characteristics of the system. 
% H includes a pronounced resonant peak, and rolls off at 20 dB/decade at high frequency. 
% It is often desirable to obtain specific numeric values for such characteristics.

% Calculate the peak gain and the frequency of the resonance.

[gpeak,fpeak] = getPeakGain(H);
gpeak_dB = mag2db(gpeak)

% getPeakGain returns both the peak location fpeak and the peak gain gpeak in absolute units. 
% Using mag2db to convert gpeak to decibels shows that the gain peaks at almost 18 dB.

% Find the band within which the system gain exceeds 0 dB, or 1 in absolute units.

wc = getGainCrossover(H,1)

% getGainCrossover returns a vector of frequencies at which the system response crosses the specified gain. 
% The resulting wc vector shows that the system gain exceeds 0 dB between about 1.3 and 12.2 rad/s.

% Find the dc gain of H.

% The Bode response plot shows that the gain of H tends toward a finite value as the frequency approaches zero. 
% The dcgain command finds this value in absolute units.

k = dcgain(H);

% Find the frequency at which the response of H rolls off to â€“10 dB relative to its dc value.

fb = bandwidth(H,-10);

% bandwidth returns the first frequency at which the system response drops below the dc gain by the specified value in dB.
