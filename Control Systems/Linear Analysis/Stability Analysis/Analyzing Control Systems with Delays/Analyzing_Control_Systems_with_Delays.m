%% Analyzing Control Systems with Delays

% This example shows how to use Control System Toolboxâ„¢ to analyze and design control systems with delays.

%%% Control of Processes with Delays

% Many processes involve dead times, also referred to as transport delays or time lags. 
% Controlling such processes is challenging because delays cause linear phase shifts 
% that limit the control bandwidth and affect closed-loop stability.

% Using the state-space representation, 
% you can create accurate open- or closed-loop models of control systems 
% with delays and analyze their stability and performance without approximation. 
% The state-space (SS) object automatically keeps track of "internal" delays 
% when combining models, see the "Specifying Time Delays" tutorial for more details.

%%% Example: PI Control Loop with Dead Time

% Consider the standard setpoint tracking loop:

figure
imshow("xxsmith_01.png")

% where the process model P has a 2.6 second dead time and the compensator C is a PI controller:

figure
imshow("MADelayResponse_eq15234508540345287191.png")

% You can specify these two transfer functions as

s = tf('s');
P = exp(-2.6*s)*(s+3)/(s^2+0.3*s+1);
C = 0.06 * (1 + 1/s);

% To analyze the closed-loop response, construct a model T of the closed-loop transfer from ysp to y. 
% Because there is a delay in this feedback loop, you must convert P and C to state space and use the state-space representation for analysis:

T = feedback(P*C,1)

% The result is a third-order model with an internal delay of 2.6 seconds. 
% Internally, the state-space object T tracks how the delay is coupled with the remaining dynamics. 
% This structural information is not visible to users, and the display above only gives the A,B,C,D values when the delay is set to zero.

% Use the STEP command to plot the closed-loop step response from ysp to y:

figure
step(T)

% The closed-loop oscillations are due to a weak gain margin as seen from the open-loop response P*C:

figure
margin(P*C)

% There is also a resonance in the closed-loop frequency response:

figure
bode(T)
grid, title('Closed-loop frequency response')

% To improve the design, you can try to notch out the resonance near 1 rad/s:

figure
notch = tf([1 0.2 1],[1 .8 1]);
C = 0.05 * (1 + 1/s);
Tnotch = feedback(P*C*notch,1);

step(Tnotch), grid

%%% Pade Approximation of Time Delays

% Many control design algorithms cannot handle time delays directly. 
% A common workaround consists of replacing delays by their Pade approximations (all-pass filters). 
% Because this approximation is only valid at low frequencies, 
% it is important to compare the true and approximate responses to choose the right approximation order and check the approximation validity.

% Use the PADE command to compute Pade approximations of LTI models with delays. 
% For the PI control example above, you can compare the exact closed-loop response T with the response obtained for a first-order Pade approximation of the delay:

figure
T1 = pade(T,1);
step(T,'b',T1,'r',100)
grid, legend('Exact','First-Order Pade')

% The approximation error is fairly large. 
% To get a better approximation, try a second-order Pade approximation of the delay:

figure
T2 = pade(T,2);
step(T,'b',T2,'r',100)
grid, legend('Exact','Second-Order Pade')

% The responses now match closely except for the non-minimum phase artifact introduced by the Pade approximation.

%%% Sensitivity Analysis

% Delays are rarely known accurately, so it is often important to understand how sensitive a control system is to the delay value. 
% Such sensitivity analysis is easily performed using LTI arrays and the InternalDelay property.

% For example, to analyze the sensitivity of the notched PI control above, create 5 models with delay values ranging from 2.0 to 3.0:

tau = linspace(2,3,5);                    % 5 delay values
Tsens = repsys(Tnotch,[1 1 5]);           % 5 copies of Tnotch
for j=1:5
  Tsens(:,:,j).InternalDelay = tau(j);    % jth delay value -> jth model
end

% Then use STEP to create an envelope plot:

figure
step(Tsens)
grid, title('Closed-loop response for 5 delay values between 2.0 and 3.0')

% This plot shows that uncertainty on the delay value has little effect on closed-loop characteristics. 
% Note that while you can change the values of internal delays, you cannot change how many there are because this is part of the model structure. 
% To eliminate some internal delays, set their value to zero or use PADE with order zero:

figure
Tnotch0 = Tnotch;
Tnotch0.InternalDelay = 0;
bode(Tnotch,'b',Tnotch0,'r',{1e-2,3})
grid, legend('Delay = 2.6','No delay','Location','SouthWest')

%%% Discretization

% You can use C2D to discretize continuous-time delay systems. Available methods include zero-order hold (ZOH), first-order hold (FOH), and Tustin. 
% For models with internal delays, the ZOH discretization is not always "exact," i.e., the continuous and discretized step responses may not match:

figure
Td = c2d(T,1);
step(T,'b',Td,'r')
grid, legend('Continuous','ZOH Discretization')

% To correct such discretization gaps, reduce the sampling period until the continuous and discrete responses match closely:

figure
Td = c2d(T,0.05);
step(T,'b',Td,'r')
grid, legend('Continuous','ZOH Discretization')

% Note that internal delays remain internal in the discretized model and do not inflate the model order:

order(Td)
Td.InternalDelay

%%% Some Unique Features of Delay Systems

% The time and frequency responses of delay systems can look bizarre and suspicious to those only familiar with delay-free LTI analysis. 
% Time responses can behave chaotically, Bode plots can exhibit gain oscillations, etc. 
% These are not software quirks but real features of such systems. 
% Below are a few illustrations of these phenomena

% Gain ripples:

figure
G = exp(-5*s)/(s+1);
T = feedback(G,.5);
bodemag(T)

% Gain oscillations:

figure
G = 1 + 0.5 * exp(-3*s);
bodemag(G)

% Jagged step response (note the "echoes" of the initial step):

figure
G = exp(-s) * (0.8*s^2+s+2)/(s^2+s);
T = feedback(G,1);
step(T)

% Chaotic response:

figure
G = 1/(s+1) + exp(-4*s);
T = feedback(1,G);

step(T)
