%% Reference Tracking of DC Motor with Parameter Variations

% This example shows how to generate an array of LTI models that represent the plant variations of a control system from a SimulinkÂ® model. 
% This array of models is used in Control System Designer for control design.

%%% DC Motor Model
% In armature-controlled DC motors, the applied voltage Va controls the angular velocity $\omega$ of the shaft. 
% A simplified model of the DC motor is shown below.

% Open the Simulink model for the DC motor.

mdl = 'scdDCMotor';
open_system(mdl)

%%% Perform Batch Linearization
% The goal of the controller is to provide tracking to step changes in reference angular velocity.

% For this example, the physical constants for the motor are:
% * R = 2.0 +/- 10% Ohms
% * L = 0.5 Henrys
% * Km = 0.1 Torque constant
% * Kb = 0.1 Back emf constant
% * Kf = 0.2 Nms
% * J = 0.02 +/- .01 kg m^2

% Note that parameters R and J are specified as a range of values.

% To design a controller which will work for all physical parameter values, create a representative set of plants by sampling these values.

% For parameters R and J, use their nominal, minimum, and maximum values.

R = [2,1.8,2.2];
J = [.02,.03,.01];

% To create an LTI array of plant models, batch linearize the DC motor plant. 
% For each combination of the sample values of R and J, linearize the Simulink model. 
% To do so, specify a linearization input point at the output of the controller block and a linearization output point with a loop opening at the output of the load block as shown in the model.

% Get the linearization analysis points specified in the model.

io = getlinio(mdl);

% Vary the plant parameters R and J.

[R_grid,J_grid] = ndgrid(R,J);
params(1).Name = 'R';
params(1).Value = R_grid;
params(2).Name = 'J';
params(2).Value = J_grid;

% Linearize the model for each parameter value combination.

sys = linearize(mdl,io,params);

%%% Open Control System Designer
% Open Control System Designer, and import the array of plant models. using the following command.
% controlSystemDesigner(sys)

% Using Control System Designer, you can design a controller for the nominal plant model while simultaneously visualizing the effect on the other plant models as shown below.

imshow("xxGraphicalEditor.png")

% The root locus editor displays the root locus for the nominal model and the closed-loop pole locations associated with the other plant models.

% The Bode editor displays both the nominal model response and the responses of the other plant models.

% The step responses show that reference tracking is not achieved for any of the plant models.

%%% Design Controller
% Using the tools in Control System Designer, design the following compensator for reference tracking.

% The resulting design is shown below. 
% The closed-loop step response shows that the goal of reference tracking is achieved with zero steady-state error for all models defined in the plant set. 
% However, if a zero percent overshoot requirement is necessary, not all responses would satisfy this requirement.

%%% Export Design and Validate in Simulink Model
% To export the designed controller to the MATLAB workspace, click Export. 
% In the Export Model dialog box, select C, and click Export. 
% Write the controller parameters to the Simulink model.

%[Cnum,Cden] = tfdata(C,'v');
%hws = get_param(mdl, 'modelworkspace');
%assignin(hws,'Cnum',Cnum)
%assignin(hws,'Cden',Cden)
