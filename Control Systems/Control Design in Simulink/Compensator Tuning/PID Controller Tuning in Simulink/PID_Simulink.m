%% PID Controller Tuning in Simulink

% This example shows how to automatically tune a PID Controller block using PID Tuner.

%%% Introduction of the PID Tuner
% PID Tuner provides a fast and widely applicable single-loop PID tuning method for the SimulinkÂ® PID Controller blocks. 
% With this method, you can tune PID controller parameters to achieve a robust design with the desired response time.

% A typical design workflow with the PID Tuner involves the following tasks:

% (1) Launch the PID Tuner. When launching, the software automatically computes a linear plant model from the Simulink model and designs an initial controller.
% (2) Tune the controller in the PID Tuner by manually adjusting design criteria in two design modes. The tuner computes PID parameters that robustly stabilize the system.
% (3) Export the parameters of the designed controller back to the PID Controller block and verify controller performance in Simulink.

%%% Open the Model
% Open the engine speed control model with PID Controller block and take a few moments to explore it.

%%% Design Overview
% In this example, you design a PI controller in an engine speed control loop. 
% The goal of the design is to track the reference signal from a Simulink step block scdspeedctrlpidblock/Speed Reference. 
% The design requirement are:

% * Settling time under 5 seconds
% * Zero steady-state error to the step reference input.

% In this example, you stabilize the feedback loop and achieve good reference tracking performance by designing the PI controller scdspeedctrl/PID Controller in the PID Tuner.

%%% Open PID Tuner
% To launch the PID Tuner, double-click the PID Controller block to open its block dialog. 
% In the Main tab, click Tune.

%%% Initial PID Design
% When the PID Tuner launches, the software computes a linearized plant model seen by the controller. 
% The software automatically identifies the plant input and output, and uses the current operating point for the linearization. 
% The plant can have any order and can have time delays.

% The PID Tuner computes an initial PI controller to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between performance and robustness. 
% By default, step reference tracking performance displays in the plot.

% The following figure shows the PID Tuner dialog with the initial design:

%%% Display PID Parameters
% Click Show parameters to view controller parameters P and I, and a set of performance and robustness measurements. 
% In this example, the initial PI controller design gives a settling time of 2 seconds, which meets the requirement.

%%% Adjust PID Design in PID Tuner
% The overshoot of the reference tracking response is about 7.5 percent. 
% Since we still have some room before reaching the settling time limit, you could reduce the overshoot by increasing the response time. 
% Move the response time slider to the left to increase the closed loop response time. 
% Notice that when you adjust response time, the response plot and the controller parameters and performance measurements update.

% The following figure shows an adjusted PID design with an overshoot of zero and a settling time of 4 seconds. 
% The designed controller effectively becomes an integral-only controller.

%%% Complete PID Design with Performance Trade-Off
% In order to achieve zero overshoot while reducing the settling time below 2 seconds, you need to take advantage of both sliders. 
% You need to make control response faster to reduce the settling time and increase the robustness to reduce the overshoot. 
% For example, you can reduce the response time from 3.4 to 1.5 seconds and increase robustness from 0.6 to 0.72.

% The following figure shows the closed-loop response with these settings:

%%% Write Tuned Parameters to PID Controller Block
% After you are happy with the controller performance on the linear plant model, you can test the design on the nonlinear model. 
% To do this, click Update Block in the PID Tuner. 
% This action writes the parameters back to the PID Controller block in the Simulink model.

% The following figure shows the updated PID Controller block dialog:

%%% Completed Design
% The following figure shows the response of the closed-loop system:

imshow("xxpid_analysisresp.png")

% The response shows that the new controller meets all the design requirements.

% You can also use the Control System Designer to design the PID Controller block, when the PID Controller block belongs to a multi-loop design task. 
% See the example Single Loop Feedback/Prefilter Compensator Design.
