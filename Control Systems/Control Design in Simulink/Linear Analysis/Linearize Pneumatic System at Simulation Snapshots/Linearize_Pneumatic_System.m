%% Linearize Pneumatic System at Simulation Snapshots

% This example shows how to linearize a SimulinkÂ® model at time-based operating point snapshots. 
% The example uses a model of the dynamics of filling a cylinder with compressed air.

%%% Pneumatic System Model
% Open the Simulink model.

mdl = 'scdpneumaticlin';
open_system(mdl)

figure;
imshow("LinearizePneumaticSystemAtSimulationSnapshotsExample_01.png")

% Simulate the model.
[t,x,y] = sim(mdl);

% In this example, the supply pressure is closed and the system has an initial pressure of 0.2 MPa. 
% The supply pressure is at 0.7 MPa. 
% In the simulation, the servo valve is opened to 0.5e-4 m. 
% During the simulation, the pressure increases from the initial pressure of 0.2 MPa and eventually settles at the supply pressure.

plot(t,y)

%%% Take Simulation Snapshots
% Compute operating points at multiple simulation times from 0 to 60 seconds in 10-second intervals. 
% The findop function simulates the model, takes a snapshot of the model conditions at each simulation time, and computes an operating point for each snapshot.
op = findop(mdl,[0 10 20 30 40 50 60]);

% View the operating point for the second snapshot time.
op(2)

%%% Linearize Model
% To linearize the model, first specify the linearization input and output points. 
% For this example, linearize the model from servo valve opening x to the output pressure.
io(1) = linio('scdpneumaticlin/x',1,'input');
io(2) = linio('scdpneumaticlin/Cylinder Pressure Model',1,'output');

% Linearize the model for all of the computed snapshots. sys is an array of state-space models.
sys = linearize(mdl,op,io);

% To see the variability in the linearizations, plot the frequency responses of the resulting linear systems.

% Close the model.
