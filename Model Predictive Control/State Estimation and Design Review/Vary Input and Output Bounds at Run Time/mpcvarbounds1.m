%% Vary Input and Output Bounds at Run Time
% This example shows how to vary input and output saturation limits in real-time control.
% For both command-line and SimulinkÂ® simulations, you specify updated input and output constraints at each control interval.
% The MPC controller then keeps the input and output signals within their specified bounds.

% For more information on updating linear constraints at run time, see Update Constraints at Run Time.

%%% Create Plant Model and MPC Controller
% Define a SISO discrete-time plant with sample time Ts.
Ts = 0.1;
plant = c2d(tf(1,[1 .8 3]),Ts);
[A,B,C,D] = ssdata(plant);

% Create an MPC controller with specified prediction horizon, p, control horizon, c, and sample time, Ts.
% Use plant as the internal prediction model.
p = 10;
m = 4;
mpcobj = mpc(plant,Ts,p,m);

% Specify controller tuning weights.
mpcobj.Weights.MV = 0;
mpcobj.Weights.MVrate = 0.5;
mpcobj.Weights.OV = 1;

% For this example, the upper and lower bounds on the manipulated variable, and the upper bound on the output variable are varied at run time.
% To do so, you must first define initial dummy finite values for these constraints in the MPC controller object.
% Specify values for MV.Min, MV.Max, and OV.Max.

% At run time, these constraints are changed using an mpcmoveopt object at the command line or corresponding input signals to the MPC Controller block.
mpcobj.MV.Min = 1;
mpcobj.MV.Max = 1;
mpcobj.OV.Max = 1;

    % from the input to the output.

    % Get the reference signal value from the data output by the Simulink
    % simulation.
    ref = yout.Data(t+1,2);

    % Update the input and output bounds. For consistency, use the
    % constraint values output by the Simulink simulation.
