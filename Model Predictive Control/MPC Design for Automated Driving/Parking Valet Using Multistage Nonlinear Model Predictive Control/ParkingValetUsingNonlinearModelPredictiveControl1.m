%% Parking Valet Using Multistage Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
% This example shows how to use the Vehicle Path Planner System block in SimulinkÂ® for a parking valet using multistage nonlinear model predictive control (NLMPC).

%%% Parking Garage
% In this example, the parking garage contains an ego vehicle and eight static obstacles.
% The obstacles are given by six parked vehicles, a reserved parking area, and the garage border.
% The goal of the ego vehicle is to park at a target pose without colliding with any of the obstacles.
% The reference point of the ego pose is located at the center of the rear axle.

% Specify the initial ego vehicle pose.
% Ego initial pose: x(m), y(m) and yaw angle (rad)
egoInitialPose = [4,12,0];

% Define the target pose for the ego vehicle.
% Ego target pose: x(m), y(m) and yaw angle (rad)
egoTargetPose = [27.2,4.7,-pi/2];

% The helperSLCreateCostmap function creates a static map of the parking lot that contains information about stationary obstacles, road markings, and parked cars.
% For more details, see the Automated Parking Valet in Simulink (Automated Driving Toolbox) example.
costmap = helperSLCreateCostmap();
helperSLCreateUtilityBus;
costmapStruct = helperSLCreateUtilityStruct(costmap);

% Visualize the parking environment. Use a sample time of 0.1 for the visualizer.
Tv = 0.1;
helperSLVisualizeParkingValet(egoInitialPose,0,costmapStruct);

% The six parked vehicles are orange boxes on the top and bottom of the figure.
% The middle area represents the reserved parking area.
% The left border of the garage is also modeled as a static obstacle.
% The ego vehicle in blue has two axles and four wheels.
% The two green boxes represent the target parking spots for the ego vehicle, with the top spot facing north.

%%% Configuration of Vehicle Path Planner System Block
% Define the parameters of the ego vehicle.
vdims = vehicleDimensions;
egoWheelbase = vdims.Wheelbase;
distToCenter = 0.5*egoWheelbase;

% Define the parameters of the eight obstacles. Each row of obsMat represents an obstacle with five elements: position (x,y), heading angle, length, and width
numObs = 8;
obsMat = [23,3.55,0,2.9,4.8;...
          31.5,3.55,0,2.9,4.8;...

% Define the sample time and prediction horizon for the MPC controller.
TsPlanner = 1;
pPlanner = 20;

% The velocity of the ego vehicle is constrained to the range [-6.5,6.5] m/s (approximately 15 mph) and the steering angle of the ego vehicle is constrained to the range [-45,45] degrees.
v_range = [-6.5,6.5];
steer_range = [-pi/4,pi/4];

% Define the safe distance in meters.
% To avoid collision with obstacles, the minimum distance to all obstacles must be greater than a safe distance.
d_safe = 0.1;

% Together with the pose of ego car and the target pose, the Vehicle Path Planner System block can generate a reference path from the current pose of the ego car to a target pose.

%%% Track Reference Trajectory in Simulink Model
% Design an NLMPC controller to track the reference trajectory.

% First, set the simulation duration.
Duration = 15;
Ts = 0.1;
Tsteps = Duration/Ts;

% Then, specify the start and end times for planning.
tmin = 5;           % start time for planning
tmax = tmin + 0.5;  % end time for planning 

% Create an NLMPC controller with a tracking prediction horizon (pTracking) of 10.
pTracking = 10;
nlobjTracking = createMPCForTrackingVPP(pTracking);

% Open the Simulink model.
mdl = 'parkingValetVPP';
