%% Lane Keeping Assist System Using Model Predictive Control
% This example shows how to use the Lane Keeping Assist System block in SimulinkÂ® and demonstrates the control objectives and constraints of this block.

%%% Lane Keeping Assist System
% A vehicle (ego car) equipped with a lane-keeping assist (LKA) system has a sensor, such as camera, that measures the lateral deviation and relative yaw angle between the centerline of a lane and the ego car.
% The sensor also measures the current lane curvature and curvature derivative.
% Depending on the curve length that the sensor can view, the curvature in front of the ego car can be calculated from the current curvature and curvature derivative.

% The LKA system keeps the ego car traveling along the centerline of the lanes on the road by adjusting the front steering angle of the ego car.
% The goal for lane keeping control is to drive both lateral deviation and relative yaw angle close to zero.

% Define the sample time, Ts, and simulation duration, T, in seconds.
Ts = 0.1;
T = 15;

% To describe the lateral vehicle dynamics, this example uses a bicycle model with the following parameters.
% - m is the total vehicle mass (kg).
% - Iz is the yaw moment of inertia of the vehicle (Kg*m^2).
% - lf is the longitudinal distance from the center of gravity to the front tires (m).
% - lr is the longitudinal distance from center of gravity to the rear tires (m).
% - Cf is the cornering stiffness of the front tires (N/rad).
% - Cr is the cornering stiffness of the rear tires (N/rad).
m = 1575;
Iz = 2875;
lf = 1.2;
lr = 1.6;
Cf = 19000;
Cr = 33000;

% You can represent the lateral vehicle dynamics using a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with the following state, input, and output variables.
% The initial conditions for the state variables are assumed to be zero.
% - State variables: Lateral velocity $V_y$ and yaw angle rate $r$
% - Input variable: Front steering angle $\delta$
% - Output variables: Same as state variables

% In this example, the longitudinal vehicle dynamics are separated from the lateral vehicle dynamics.
% Therefore, the longitudinal velocity is assumed to be constant.
% In practice, the longitudinal velocity can vary.
% The Lane Keeping Assist System block uses adaptive MPC to adjust the model of the lateral dynamics accordingly.

% Specify the longitudinal velocity in m/s.
Vx = 15;

% Specify a state-space model, G(s), of the lateral vehicle dynamics.
A = [-(2*Cf+2*Cr)/m/Vx, -Vx-(2*Cf*lf-2*Cr*lr)/m/Vx;...
     -(2*Cf*lf-2*Cr*lr)/Iz/Vx, -(2*Cf*lf^2+2*Cr*lr^2)/Iz/Vx];
B = [2*Cf/m, 2*Cf*lf/Iz]';
C = eye(2);
G = ss(A,B,C,0);

%%% Sensor Dynamics and Curvature Previewer
% In this example, the Sensor Dynamics block outputs the lateral deviation and relative yaw angle.
% The dynamics for relative yaw angle are $$\dot{e}_2 = r-V_x\rho$, where $\rho$ denotes the curvature.
% The dynamics for lateral deviation are $\dot{e}_1 = V_x e_2+V_y$.

% The Curvature Previewer block outputs the previewed curvature with a look-ahead time of one second.
% Therefore, given a sample time $Ts = 0.1$, the prediction horizon 10 steps.
% The curvature used in this example is calculated based on trajectories for a double lane change maneuver.

% Specify the prediction horizon and obtain the previewed curvature.
PredictionHorizon = 10;

time = 0:0.1:15;
md = getCurvature(Vx,time);

%%% Configuration of the Lane Keeping Assist System Block
% The LKA system is modeled in Simulink using the Lane Keeping Assist System block.
% The inputs to the LKA system block are:
% - Previewed curvature (from lane detections)
% - Ego longitudinal velocity
% - Lateral deviation (from lane detections)
% - Relative yaw angle (from lane detections)

% The output of the LKA system is the front steering angle of the ego car.
% Considering the physical limitations of the ego car, the steering angle is constrained to the range [-0.5,0.5] rad/s.
u_min = -0.5;
u_max = 0.5;

% For this example, the default parameters of the Lane Keeping Assist System block match the simulation parameters.
% If your simulation parameters differ from the default values, update the block parameters accordingly.
