%% Adaptive MPC Control of Nonlinear Chemical Reactor Using Online Model Estimation
% This example shows how to use an Adaptive MPC controller to control a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) as it transitions from low conversion rate to high conversion rate.

% A discrete time ARX model is being identified online by the Recursive Polynomial Model Estimator block at each control interval.
% The adaptive MPC controller uses it to update internal plant model and achieves nonlinear control successfully.

%%% About the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor
% A Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is a common chemical system in the process industry.
% A schematic of the CSTR system is:

axis off;

% This is a jacketed non-adiabatic tank reactor described extensively in Seborg's book, "Process Dynamics and Control", published by Wiley, 2004.
% The vessel is assumed to be perfectly mixed, and a single first-order exothermic and irreversible reaction, A --> B, takes place.
% The inlet stream of reagent A is fed to the tank at a constant volumetric rate.
% The product stream exits continuously at the same volumetric rate and liquid density is constant.
% Thus the volume of reacting liquid is constant.

% The inputs of the CSTR model are:

% and the outputs (y(t)), which are also the states of the model (x(t)), are:

% The control objective is to maintain the reactor temperature $T$ at its desired setpoint, which changes over time when reactor transitions from low conversion rate to high conversion rate.
% The coolant temperature $T_c$ is the manipulated variable used by the MPC controller to track the reference as well as reject the measured disturbance arising from the inlet feed stream temperature $T_i$.
% The inlet feed stream concentration, $CA_i$, is assumed to be constant.
% The Simulink model mpc_cstr_plant implements the nonlinear CSTR plant.
% For more information on the CSTR reactor and related examples, see CSTR Model.

%%% About Adaptive Model Predictive Control
% It is well known that the CSTR dynamics are strongly nonlinear with respect to reactor temperature variations and can be open-loop unstable during the transition from one operating condition to another.
% A single MPC controller designed at a particular operating condition cannot give satisfactory control performance over a wide operating range.

% To control the nonlinear CSTR plant with linear MPC control technique, you have a few options:
% - If a linear plant model cannot be obtained at run time, first you need to obtain several linear plant models offline at different operating conditions that cover the typical operating range.
% Next you can choose one of the two approaches to implement MPC control strategy:

% (1) Design several MPC controllers offline, one for each plant model.
% At run time, use Multiple MPC Controller block that switches MPC controllers from one to another based on a desired scheduling strategy.
% See Gain-Scheduled MPC Control of Nonlinear Chemical Reactor for more details.
% Use this approach when the plant models have different orders or time delays.

% (2) Design one MPC controller offline at the initial operating point.
% At run time, use Adaptive MPC Controller block (updating predictive model at each control interval) together with Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) System block (supplying linear plant model with a scheduling strategy).
% See Adaptive MPC Control of Nonlinear Chemical Reactor Using Linear Parameter-Varying System for more details.
% Use this approach when all the plant models have the same order and time delay.
% - If a linear plant model can be obtained at run time, you should use Adaptive MPC Controller block to achieve nonlinear control.
% There are two typical ways to obtain a linear plant model online:

% (1) Use successive linearization.
% See Adaptive MPC Control of Nonlinear Chemical Reactor Using Successive Linearization for more details.
% Use this approach when a nonlinear plant model is available and can be linearized at run time.
% (2) Use online estimation to identify a linear model when loop is closed, as shown in this example.
% Use this approach when the plant does not exhibit fast unstable dynamics and when a linear model cannot be obtained from either an LPV system or successive linearization.

%%% Obtain Linear Plant Model at Initial Operating Condition
% To implement an adaptive MPC controller, first you need to design a MPC controller at the initial operating point where CAi is 10 kgmol/m^3, Ti and Tc are 298.15 K.

% Create operating point specification.
plant_mdl = 'mpc_cstr_plant';
op = operspec(plant_mdl);

% Feed concentration is known at the initial condition.
op.Inputs(1).u = 10;
op.Inputs(1).Known = true;

% Feed temperature is known at the initial condition.
op.Inputs(2).u = 298.15;
op.Inputs(2).Known = true;

% Coolant temperature is known at the initial condition.
op.Inputs(3).u = 298.15;
op.Inputs(3).Known = true;

% Compute initial condition.
[op_point, op_report] = findop(plant_mdl,op);

% Obtain nominal values of x, y and u.
x0 = [op_report.States(1).x;op_report.States(2).x];
y0 = [op_report.Outputs(1).y;op_report.Outputs(2).y];
u0 = [op_report.Inputs(1).u;op_report.Inputs(2).u;op_report.Inputs(3).u];

% Obtain linear plant model at the initial condition.
sys = linearize(plant_mdl, op_point);

% Drop the first plant input CAi and second output CA because they are not used by MPC.
sys = sys(1,2:3);

% Discretize the plant model because Adaptive MPC controller only accepts a discrete-time plant model.
Ts = 0.5;
plant = c2d(sys,Ts);

%%% Design MPC Controller
% You design an MPC at the initial operating condition.
% When running in the adaptive mode, the plant model is updated at run time.

% Specify signal types used in MPC.
plant.InputGroup.MeasuredDisturbances = 1;
plant.InputGroup.ManipulatedVariables = 2;
plant.OutputGroup.Measured = 1;
plant.InputName = {'Ti','Tc'};
plant.OutputName = {'T'};

% Create MPC controller with default prediction and control horizons
mpcobj = mpc(plant);

% Set nominal values in the controller
mpcobj.Model.Nominal = struct('X', x0, 'U', u0(2:3), 'Y', y0(1), 'DX', [0 0]);

% Set scale factors because plant input and output signals have different orders of magnitude
Uscale = [30 50];
Yscale = 50;
mpcobj.DV.ScaleFactor = Uscale(1);
mpcobj.MV.ScaleFactor = Uscale(2);
mpcobj.OV.ScaleFactor = Yscale;

% Due to the physical constraint of coolant jacket, Tc rate of change is bounded by 2 degrees per minute.
mpcobj.MV.RateMin = -2;
mpcobj.MV.RateMax = 2;

% Reactor concentration is not directly controlled in this example.
% If reactor temperature can be successfully controlled, the concentration will achieve desired performance requirement due to the strongly coupling between the two variables.

%%% Implement Adaptive MPC Control of CSTR Plant in SimulinkÂ®
% Open the Simulink model.
mdl = 'ampc_cstr_estimation';
open_system(mdl);

% The model includes three parts:
% 1. The "CSTR" block implements the nonlinear plant model.
% 2. The "Adaptive MPC Controller" block runs the designed MPC controller in the adaptive mode.
% 3. The "Recursive Polynomial Model Estimator" block estimates a two-input (Ti and Tc) and one-output (T) discrete time ARX model based on the measured temperatures.
% The estimated model is then converted into state space form by the "Model Type Converter" block and fed to the "Adaptive MPC Controller" block at each control interval.

% In this example, the initial plant model is used to initialize the online estimator with parameter covariance matrix set to 1.
% The online estimation method is "Kalman Filter" with noise covariance matrix set to 0.01.
% The online estimation result is sensitive to these parameters and you can further adjust them to achieve better estimation result.

% Both "Recursive Polynomial Model Estimator" and "Model Type Converter" are provided by System Identification Toolbox.
% You can use the two blocks as a template to develop appropriate online model estimation for your own applications.

% The initial value of A(q) and B(q) variables are populated with the numerator and denominator of the initial plant model.
[num, den] = tfdata(plant);
Aq = den{1};
Bq = num;

% Note that the new linear plant model must be a discrete time state space system with the same order and sample time as the original plant model has.
% If the plant has time delay, it must also be same as the original time delay and absorbed into the state space model.

%%% Validate Adaptive MPC Control Performance
% Controller performance is validated against both setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection.
% - Tracking: reactor temperature T setpoint transitions from original 311 K (low conversion rate) to 377 K (high conversion rate) kgmol/m^3.
% - Regulating: feed temperature Ti has slow fluctuation represented by a sine wave with amplitude of 5 degrees, which is a measured disturbance fed to MPC controller.

% Simulate the closed-loop performance.

%%% Compare with Non-Adaptive MPC Control
