%% Time-Varying MPC Control of a Time-Varying Plant
% This example shows how the Model Predictive Control Toolboxâ„¢ can use time-varying prediction models to achieve better performance when controlling a time-varying plant.

% The following MPC controllers are compared:
% 1. Linear MPC controller based on a time-invariant average model
% 2. Linear MPC controller based on a time-invariant model, which is updated at each time step.
% 3. Linear MPC controller based on a time-varying prediction model.

%%% Time-Varying Linear Plant
% In this example, the plant is a single-input-single-output 3rd order time-varying linear system with poles, zeros and gain that vary periodically with time.

% The plant poles move between being stable and unstable at run time, which leads to a challenging control problem.

% Generate an array of plant models at t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 10 seconds.
Models = tf;
ct = 1;
for t = 0:0.1:10
    Models(:,:,ct) = tf([5 5+2*cos(2.5*t)],[1 3 2 6+sin(5*t)]);
    ct = ct + 1;
end

% Convert the models to state-space format and discretize them with a sample time of 0.1 second.
Ts = 0.1;
Models = ss(c2d(Models,Ts));

%%% MPC Controller Design
% The control objective is to track a step change in the reference signal.
% First, design an MPC controller for the average plant model.
% The controller sample time is 0.1 second.
sys = ss(c2d(tf([5 5],[1 3 2 6]),Ts));  % prediction model
p = 3;                                  % prediction horizon
m = 3;                                  % control horizon
mpcobj = mpc(sys,Ts,p,m);

% Set hard constraints on the manipulated variable and specify tuning weights.
mpcobj.MV = struct('Min',-2,'Max',2);
mpcobj.Weights = struct('MV',0,'MVRate',0.01,'Output',1);

% Set the initial plant states to zero.
x0 = zeros(size(sys.B));

%%% Closed-Loop Simulation with Implicit MPC
% Run a closed-loop simulation to examine whether the designed implicit MPC controller can achieve the control objective without updating the plant model used in prediction.

% Set the simulation duration to 5 seconds.
Tstop = 5;

% Use the mpcmove command in a loop to simulate the closed-loop response.
yyMPC = [];

x = x0;
xmpc = mpcstate(mpcobj);
fprintf('Simulating MPC controller based on average LTI model.\n');
for ct = 1:(Tstop/Ts+1)
    % Get the real plant.
    real_plant = Models(:,:,ct);
    % Update and store the plant output.
    y = real_plant.C*x;
    yyMPC = [yyMPC,y];
    % Compute and store the MPC optimal move.
    u = mpcmove(mpcobj,xmpc,y,1);
    uuMPC = [uuMPC,u];
    % Update the plant state.
    x = real_plant.A*x + real_plant.B*u;
end

%%% Closed-Loop Simulation with Adaptive MPC
% Run a second simulation to examine whether an adaptive MPC controller can achieve the control objective.

% Use the mpcmoveAdaptive command in a loop to simulate the closed-loop response.
% Update the plant model for each control interval, and use the updated model to compute the optimal control moves.
% The mpcmoveAdaptive command uses the same prediction model across the prediction horizon.

    % Update and store the plant output.
    y = real_plant.C*x;
    yyAMPC = [yyAMPC, y];
    % Compute and store the MPC optimal move.
    u = mpcmoveAdaptive(mpcobj,xmpc,real_plant,nominal,y,1);
    uuAMPC = [uuAMPC,u];
    % Update the plant state.
    x = real_plant.A*x + real_plant.B*u;
end

%%% Closed-Loop Simulation with Time-Varying MPC
% Run a third simulation to examine whether a time-varying MPC controller can achieve the control objective.

% The controller updates the prediction model at each control interval and also uses time-varying models across the prediction horizon, which gives MPC controller the best knowledge of plant behavior in the future.

% Use the mpcmoveAdaptive command in a loop to simulate the closed-loop response.
% Specify an array of plant models rather than a single model.
% The controller uses each model in the array at a different prediction horizon step.
yyLTVMPC = [];
uuLTVMPC = [];
x = x0;
xmpc = mpcstate(mpcobj);
Nominals = repmat(nominal,3,1); % Nominal conditions are constant over the prediction horizon.

    y = real_plant.C*x;
    yyLTVMPC = [yyLTVMPC, y];
    % Compute and store the MPC optimal move.
    u = mpcmoveAdaptive(mpcobj,xmpc,Models(:,:,ct:ct+p),Nominals,y,1);
    uuLTVMPC = [uuLTVMPC,u];
    % Update the plant state.
