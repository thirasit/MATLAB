%% Model Predictive Control of Multi-Input Single-Output Plant
% This example shows how to design, analyze, and simulate a model predictive controller with hard and soft constraints for a plant with one measured output (MO) and three inputs.
% The inputs consist of one manipulated variable (MV), one measured disturbance (MD), and one unmeasured disturbance (UD).
% After designing a controller and analyzing its closed-loop steady-state gains, you perform simulations with the sim command, in a for loop using mpcmove, and with SimulinkÂ®.
% Simulations with model mismatches, without constraints, and in open-loop are shown.
% Input and output disturbances and noise models are also treated, as well as how to change the Kalman gains of the built-in state estimator.

%%% Define Plant Model
% Define a plant model.
% For this example, use continuous-time transfer functions from each input to the output.
plantTF = tf({1,1,1},{[1 .5 1],[1 1],[.7 .5 1]}) % define and display tf object

% For this example, explicitly convert the plant to a discrete-time state-space form before passing it to the MPC controller creation function.
% The controller creation function can accept either continuous-time or discrete-time plants.
% During initialization, a continuous-time plant (in any format) is automatically converted into a discrete-time state-space model using the zero-order hold (ZOH) method.
% Delays, if present, are incorporated in the state-space model.
% You can convert the plant to discrete-time yourself when you need the discrete-time system matrices for analysis or simulation (as in this example) or when you want to use a discrete-time conversion method other than ZOH.
plantCSS = ss(plantTF);         % transfer function to continuous state space
Ts = 0.2;                       % specify a sample time of 0.2 seconds
plantDSS = c2d(plantCSS,Ts)     % convert to discrete-time state space, using ZOH

% By default, the software assumes that all the plant input signals are manipulated variables.
% To specify the signal types, such as measured and unmeasured disturbances, use the setmpcsignals function.
% In this example, the first input signal is a manipulated variable, the second is a measured disturbance, and the third is an unmeasured disturbance.
% This information is stored in the plant model plantDSS and later used by the MPC controller.
plantDSS = setmpcsignals(plantDSS,'MV',1,'MD',2,'UD',3); % specify signal types

%%% Design MPC Controller
% Create the controller object, specifying the sample time, as well as the prediction and control horizons (10 and 3 steps, respectively).
mpcobj = mpc(plantDSS,Ts,10,3);

% Since you have not specified the weights of the quadratic cost function to be minimized, the controller uses their default values (0 for manipulated variables, 0.1 for manipulated variable rates, and 1 for the output variables).
% Also, at this point the MPC problem is still unconstrained as you have not specified any constraint yet.

% Define hard constraints on the manipulated variable.
mpcobj.MV = struct('Min',0,'Max',1,'RateMin',-10,'RateMax',10);

% You can use input and output disturbance models to define the dynamic characteristics of additive input and output unmeasured disturbances.
% These models allow the controller to better reject such disturbances, if they occur at run time.
% By default, to be able to better reject step-like disturbances, mpc uses an integrator as disturbance model for:
% - Each unmeasured disturbance input and
% - Each unmeasured disturbance acting on each measured outputs
% unless doing so causes a violation of state observability.

% The MPC object also has a noise model that specifies the characteristics of the additive noise that is expected on the measured output variables.
% By default, this, is assumed to be a unit static gain, which is equivalent to assuming that the controller expects the measured output variables to be affected, at run time, by white noise (with a covariance matrix that depends on the input matrices of the whole prediction model).
% For more information, see MPC Prediction Models.

% Display the input disturbance model. As expected, it is a discrete-time integrator.
getindist(mpcobj)

% Display the output disturbance model.
getoutdist(mpcobj)

% Specify the disturbance model for the unmeasured input as an integrator driven by white noise with variance 1000.
mpcobj.Model.Disturbance = tf(sqrt(1000),[1 0]);

% Display the input disturbance model again to verify that it changed.
getindist(mpcobj)

% Display the MPC controller object mpcobj to review its properties.
mpcobj

%%% Examine Steady-State Offset
% To examine whether the MPC controller can reject constant output disturbances and track a constant setpoint with zero offsets in steady state, calculate the closed-loop DC gain from output disturbances to controlled outputs using the cloffset command.
% This gain is also known as the steady state output sensitivity of the closed loop.
DC = cloffset(mpcobj);
fprintf('DC gain from output disturbance to output = %5.8f (=%g) \n',DC,DC);

% A zero gain, which is typically the result of the controller having integrators as input or output disturbance models, means that the measured plant output tracks the desired output reference setpoint perfectly in steady state.

%%% Simulate Closed-Loop Response Using sim
% The sim command provides a quick way to simulate an MPC controller in a closed loop with a linear time-invariant plant when constraints and weights stay constant and you can easily and completely specify the disturbance and reference signals ahead of time.

% First, specify the simulation time and the reference and disturbance signals

Tstop = 30;                               % simulation time
Nf = round(Tstop/Ts);                     % number of simulation steps
r = ones(Nf,1);                           % output reference signal
v = [zeros(Nf/3,1);ones(2*Nf/3,1)];       % measured input disturbance signal

% Run the closed-loop simulation and plot the results.
% The plant specified in mpcobj.Model.Plant is used both as the plant in the closed-loop simulation and as the internal plant model used by the controller to predict the response over the prediction horizon.
% The plant model is discretized or resampled if needed, and the simulation runs in discrete time, with sample time mpcobj.Ts.

% Use sim to simulate the closed-loop response to reference r and measured input disturbance v system for Nf steps.
sim(mpcobj,Nf,r,v)      % simulate plant and controller in closed loop

% The manipulated variable hits the upper bound initially, and brings the plant output to the reference value within a few seconds.
% The manipulated variable then settles at its maximum allowed value, 1.
% After 10 seconds, the measured disturbance signal rises from 0 to 1, which causes the plant output to exceed its reference value by about 30%.
% The manipulated variable hits the lower bound in an effort to reject the disturbance.
% The controller is able to bring the plant output back to the reference value after a few seconds, and the manipulated variable settles at its minimum value.
% The unmeasured disturbance signal is always zero, because no unmeasured disturbance signal has been specified yet.

% You can use a simulation options object to specify additional simulation options and additional signals, such as noise and unmeasured disturbances, that feed into the plant but are unknown to the controller.
% For this example, use a simulation option object to add an unmeasured input disturbance signal to the manipulated variable and to add noise on the measured output signal.
% Create a simulation options object with default options.
SimOptions = mpcsimopt;                       % create object

% Create a disturbance signal and specify it in the simulation options object.
d = [zeros(2*Nf/3,1);-0.5*ones(Nf/3,1)];      % step disturbance
SimOptions.UnmeasuredDisturbance = d;         % unmeasured input disturbance

% Specify noise signals in the simulation options object.
% At simulation time, the simulation function directly adds the specified output noise to the measured output before feeding it to the controller.
% It also directly adds the specified input noise to the manipulated variable (not to any disturbance signals) before feeding it to the plant.
SimOptions.OutputNoise=.001*(rand(Nf,1)-.5);  % output measurement noise
SimOptions.InputNoise=.05*(rand(Nf,1)-.5);    % noise on manipulated variables

% You can also use the OutputNoise field of the simulation option object to specify a more general additive output disturbance signal (such as a step) on the measured plant output.

% Simulate the closed-loop system and save the results to the workspace variables y, t, u, and xp.
% Saving this variables allows you to selectively plot signals in a new figure window and in any given color and order.
[y,t,u,xp] = sim(mpcobj,Nf,r,v,SimOptions);

% Plot the results.
figure                                  % create new figure

subplot(2,1,1)                          % create upper subplot
plot(0:Nf-1,y,0:Nf-1,r)                 % plot plant output and reference
title('Output')                         % add title so upper subplot
ylabel('MO1')                           % add a label to the upper y axis
grid                                    % add a grid to upper subplot

subplot(2,1,2)                          % create lower subplot
plot(0:Nf-1,u)                          % plot manipulated variable
title('Input');                         % add title so lower subplot
xlabel('Simulation Steps')              % add a label to the lower x axis
ylabel('MV1')                           % add a label to the lower y axis
grid                                    % add a grid to lower subplot

% Despite the added noise, which is especially visible on the manipulated variable plot, and despite the measured and unmeasured disturbances starting after 50 and 100 steps, respectively, the controller is able to achieve good tracking.
% The manipulated variable settles at about 1 after the initial part of the simulation (steps from 20 to 50), at about 0 to reject the measured disturbance (steps from 70 to 100), and at about 0.5 to reject both disturbances (steps from 120 to 150).

%%% Simulate Closed-Loop Response with Model Mismatch
% Test the robustness of the MPC controller against a model mismatch.
% Specify the true plant that you want to use in simulation as truePlantCSS.
% For this example, the denominator of each of the three plant transfer functions has one or two coefficients that differ from the corresponding ones in the plant defined earlier in Define Plant model section, which the MPC controller uses for prediction.
truePlantTF = tf({1,1,1},{[1 .8 1],[1 2],[.6 .6 1]})    % specify and display transfer functions
truePlantCSS = ss(truePlantTF);                         % convert to continuous state space
truePlantCSS = setmpcsignals(truePlantCSS,'MV',1,'MD',2,'UD',3); % specify signal types

% Update the simulation option object by specifying SimOptions.Model as a structure with two fields, Plant (containing the true plant model) and Nominal (containing the operating point values for the true plant).
% For this example, the nominal values for the state derivatives and the inputs are not specified, so they are assumed to be zero, resulting in y = SimOptions.Model.Nominal.Y + C*(x-SimOptions.Model.Nominal.X), where x and y are the state and measured output of the plant, respectively.
% create the structure and assign the 'Plant' field
SimOptions.Model = struct('Plant',truePlantCSS);

% create and assign the 'Nominal.Y' field
SimOptions.Model.Nominal.Y = 0.1;

% create and assign the 'Nominal.X' field
SimOptions.Model.Nominal.X = -.1*[1 1 1 1 1];

% specify the initial state of the true plant
SimOptions.PlantInitialState = [0.1 0 -0.1 0 .05];

% Remove any signal that have been added to the measured output and to the manipulated variable.
SimOptions.OutputNoise = [];            % remove output measurement noise
SimOptions.InputNoise = [];             % remove noise on manipulated variable

% Run the closed-loop simulation and plot the results.
% Since SimOptions.Model is not empty, SimOptions.Model.Plant is converted to discrete time (using zero order hold) and used as the plant in the closed loop simulation, while the plant in mpcobj.Model.Plant is only used by the controller to predict the response over the prediction horizon.
sim(mpcobj,Nf,r,v,SimOptions)           % simulate the closed loop

% As a result of the model mismatch, some degradation in the response is visible; notably, the controller needs a little more time to achieve tracking and the manipulated variable now settles at about 0.5 to reject the measured disturbance (see values from 5 to 10 seconds) and settles at about 0.9 to reject both input disturbances (from 25 to 30 seconds). 
% Despite this degradation, the controller is still able to track the output reference.

%%% Simulate Open-Loop Response
% You can also test the behavior of the plant and controller in open-loop, using the sim command.
% Set the OpenLoop flag to on, and provide a sequence of manipulated variable values to excite the system (the sequence is ignored if OpenLoop is set to off).
SimOptions.OpenLoop = 'on';                 % set open loop option
SimOptions.MVSignal = sin((0:Nf-1)'/10);    % define mv signal

% Simulate the true plant (previously specified in SimOptions.Model) in open loop.
% Since the reference signal is ignored in an open-loop simulation specify it as [].
sim(mpcobj,Nf,[],v,SimOptions)              % simulate the open loop system

%%% Soften Constraints
% For an MPC controller, each constraint has an associated dimensionless ECR value.
% A constraint with a larger ECR value is allowed to be violated more than a constraint with a smaller ECR value.
% By default all constraints on the manipulated variables have an ECR value of zero, making them hard.
% You can specify a nonzero ECR value for a constraint to make it soft.

% Relax the constraints on manipulated variables from hard to soft.
mpcobj.ManipulatedVariables.MinECR = 1;   % ECR for the MV lower bound
mpcobj.ManipulatedVariables.MaxECR = 1;   % ECR for the MV upped bound

% Define an output constraint. By default all constraints on output variables (measured outputs) have an ECR value of one, making them soft.
% You can reduce the ECR value for an output constraint to make it harder, however best practice is to keep output constraints soft.
% Soft output constraints are preferred because plant outputs depend on both plant states and measured disturbances;
% therefore, if a large enough disturbance occurs, the plant outputs constraints can be violated regardless of the plant state (and therefore regardless of any control action taken by the MPC controller).
% These violation are especially likely when the manipulated variables have hard constraints.
% Such an unavoidable violation of a hard constraint results in an infeasible MPC problem, for which no manipulated variable can be calculated.
mpcobj.OutputVariables.Max = 1.1;    % define the (soft) output constraint

% Run a new closed-loop simulation, without including the simulation option object, and therefore without any model mismatch, unmeasured disturbance, or noise added to the manipulated variable or measured output.
sim(mpcobj,Nf,r,v)          % simulate the closed loop

% In an effort to reject the measured disturbance, achieve tracking, and prevent the output from rising above its soft constraint of 1.1, the controller slightly violates the soft constraint on the manipulated variable, which reaches small negative values from seconds 10 to 11.
% The controller violates the constraint on the measured output more than the constraint on the manipulated variable.
% Harden the constraint on the output variable and rerun the simulation.

mpcobj.OV.MaxECR = 0.001;   % the closer to zero, the harder the constraint
sim(mpcobj,Nf,r,v)          % run a new closed-loop simulation.

% Now the controller violates the output constraint only slightly.
% This output performance improvement comes at the cost of violating the manipulated variable constraint a lot more (the manipulated variable reaches a value of -3).

%%% Change Built-In State Estimator Kalman Gains
% At each time step, the MPC controller computes the manipulated variable by solving a constrained quadratic optimization problem that depends on the current state of the plant.
% Since the plant state is often not directly measurable, by default, the controller uses a linear Kalman filter as an observer to estimate the state of the plant and the disturbance and noise models.
% Therefore, the states of the controller are the states of this Kalman filter, which are in turn the estimates of the states of the augmented discrete-time plant.
% Run a closed-loop simulation with model mismatch and unmeasured disturbance, using the default estimator, and return the controller state structure xc.
SimOptions.OpenLoop = 'off';                    % set closed loop option
[y,t,u,xp,xc] = sim(mpcobj,Nf,r,v,SimOptions);  % run simulation

%%% Simulate Controller in Closed Loop Using mpcmove
% For more general applications, you can simulate an MPC controller in a for loop using the mpcmove function.
% Using this function, you can run simulations with the following features.
% - Nonlinear or time-varying plants
% - Constraints or weights that vary at run time
% - Disturbance or reference signals that are not known before running the simulation

% If your plant is continuous, you can either convert it to discrete time before simulating or you can use a numerical integration algorithm (such as forward Euler or ode45) to simulate it in a closed loop using mpcmove.
% For example, you can calculate the plant state at the next control interval using the following methods:
% - Discrete time plant x(t+1)=f(x(t),u(t)): x = f(x,u), (typically x = A*x + B*u for linear plant models)
% - Continuous time plant dx(t)/dt=f(x(t),u(t)), sample time Ts, Euler method: x = x + f(x,u)*Ts
% - Continuous time plant as above, using ode45: [~,xhist] = ode45(@(t,xode) f(xode,u),[0 Ts],x); x = xhist(end);

% In the third case, ode45 starts from the initial condition x and simulates the plant for Ts seconds, under a constant control signal u.
% The last value of the resulting state signal xhist is the plant state at the next control interval.

% First, obtain the discrete-time state-space matrices of the plant, and define the simulation time and initial states for plant and controller.
[A,B,C,D] = ssdata(plantDSS);       % discrete-time plant plant ss matrices
Tstop = 30;                         % simulation time

r = 1;                              % output reference signal

% Display the initial state of the controller.
% The state, which is an mpcstate object, contains the controller states only at the current time.
% Specifically: * xmpc.Plant is the current value of the estimated plant states.
% * xmpc.Disturbance is the current value of the disturbance models states.
% * xmpc.Noise is the current value of the noise models states.
% * xmpc.LastMove is the last value of the manipulated variable.
% * xmpc.Covariance is the current value of the estimator covariance matrix.
xmpc                                % display controller states

% Note that xmpc is a handle object, which always points to the current state of the controller.

info

% info is a structure containing the predicted optimal sequences of manipulated variables, plant states, and outputs over the prediction horizon.
% mpcmove calculated this sequence, together with the optimal first move, by solving a quadratic optimization problem to minimize the cost function.
% The plant states and outputs in info result from applying the optimal manipulated variable sequence directly to mpcobj.Model.Plant, in an open-loop fashion.
% Due to the presence of noise, unmeasured disturbances, and uncertainties, this open-loop optimization process is not equivalent to simulating the closed loop consisting of the plant, estimator and controller using either the sim command or mpcmove iteratively in a for loop.

%%% Linear Representation of MPC Controller
% When the constraints are not active, the MPC controller behaves like a linear controller.
% Note that for a finite-time unconstrained Linear Quadratic Regulator problem with a finite non-receding horizon, the value function is time-dependent, which causes the optimal feedback gain to be time varying.
% In contrast, in MPC the horizon has a constant length because it is always receding, resulting in a time-invariant value function and consequently a time-invariant optimal feedback gain.
