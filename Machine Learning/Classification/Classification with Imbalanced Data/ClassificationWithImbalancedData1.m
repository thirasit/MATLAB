%% Classification with Imbalanced Data
% This example shows how to perform classification when one class has many more observations than another.
% You use the RUSBoost algorithm first, because it is designed to handle this case.
% Another way to handle imbalanced data is to use the name-value pair arguments 'Prior' or 'Cost'.
% For details, see Handle Imbalanced Data or Unequal Misclassification Costs in Classification Ensembles.

% This example uses the "Cover type" data from the UCI machine learning archive, described in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype.
% The data classifies types of forest (ground cover), based on predictors such as elevation, soil type, and distance to water.
% The data has over 500,000 observations and over 50 predictors, so training and using a classifier is time consuming.

% Blackard and Dean [1] describe a neural net classification of this data.
% They quote a 70.6% classification accuracy.
% RUSBoost obtains over 81% classification accuracy.

%%% Obtain the data
% Import the data into your workspace. Extract the last data column into a variable named Y.
gunzip('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/covtype.data.gz')
load covtype.data
Y = covtype(:,end);
covtype(:,end) = [];

%%% Examine the response data
tabulate(Y)

% There are hundreds of thousands of data points.
% Those of class 4 are less than 0.5% of the total.
% This imbalance indicates that RUSBoost is an appropriate algorithm.

%%% Partition the data for quality assessment
% Use half the data to fit a classifier, and half to examine the quality of the resulting classifier.
rng(10,'twister')         % For reproducibility
part = cvpartition(Y,'Holdout',0.5);
istrain = training(part); % Data for fitting
istest = test(part);      % Data for quality assessment
tabulate(Y(istrain))

%%% Create the ensemble
% Use deep trees for higher ensemble accuracy.
% To do so, set the trees to have maximal number of decision splits of N, where N is the number of observations in the training sample.
% Set LearnRate to 0.1 in order to achieve higher accuracy as well.
% The data is large, and, with deep trees, creating the ensemble is time consuming.
N = sum(istrain);         % Number of observations in the training sample
t = templateTree('MaxNumSplits',N);
tic
rusTree = fitcensemble(covtype(istrain,:),Y(istrain),'Method','RUSBoost', ...
    'NumLearningCycles',1000,'Learners',t,'LearnRate',0.1,'nprint',100);
toc

%%% Inspect the classification error
% Plot the classification error against the number of members in the ensemble.
figure;
tic
plot(loss(rusTree,covtype(istest,:),Y(istest),'mode','cumulative'));
toc
grid on;
xlabel('Number of trees');
ylabel('Test classification error');

% The ensemble achieves a classification error of under 20% using 116 or more trees.
% For 500 or more trees, the classification error decreases at a slower rate.

% Examine the confusion matrix for each class as a percentage of the true class.
tic
Yfit = predict(rusTree,covtype(istest,:));
toc

confusionchart(Y(istest),Yfit,'Normalization','row-normalized','RowSummary','row-normalized')

% All classes except class 2 have over 90% classification accuracy.
% But class 2 makes up close to half the data, so the overall accuracy is not that high.

%%% Compact the ensemble
% The ensemble is large.
% Remove the data using the compact method.
cmpctRus = compact(rusTree);

sz(1) = whos('rusTree');
sz(2) = whos('cmpctRus');
[sz(1).bytes sz(2).bytes]

% The compacted ensemble is about half the size of the original.

% Remove half the trees from cmpctRus.
% This action is likely to have minimal effect on the predictive performance, based on the observation that 500 out of 1000 trees give nearly optimal accuracy.
cmpctRus = removeLearners(cmpctRus,[500:1000]);

sz(3) = whos('cmpctRus');
sz(3).bytes

% The reduced compact ensemble takes about a quarter of the memory of the full ensemble.
% Its overall loss rate is under 19%:
L = loss(cmpctRus,covtype(istest,:),Y(istest))

% The predictive accuracy on new data might differ, because the ensemble accuracy might be biased.
% The bias arises because the same data used for assessing the ensemble was used for reducing the ensemble size.
% To obtain an unbiased estimate of requisite ensemble size, you should use cross validation.
% However, that procedure is time consuming.
