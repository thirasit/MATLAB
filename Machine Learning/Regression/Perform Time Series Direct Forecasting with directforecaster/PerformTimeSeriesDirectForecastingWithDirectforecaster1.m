%% Perform Time Series Direct Forecasting with directforecaster
% Perform time series direct forecasting with the directforecaster function.
% The function creates a forecasting model that uses a direct strategy in which a separate regression model is trained for each step of the forecasting horizon.
% For more information, see Direct Forecasting.

% Use different validation schemes, such as holdout, expanding window, and sliding window, to assess the performance of the forecasting model.
% Then use the model to forecast at time steps beyond the available data.

%%% Load and Visualize Data
% Load the data in electricityclient.mat, which is a subset of the ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014 data set available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1].
% The original data set contains the electricity consumption (in kWh) of 321 clients, logged every 15 minutes from 2012 to 2014, as described in [2].
% The smaller usagedata timetable contains the hourly electricity consumption of the sixth client only.
load electricityclient.mat

% Plot the electricity consumption of the sixth client during the first 200 hours.
% Overall, the electricity consumption of this client shows a periodicity of 24 hours.

hrs = 1:200;

% Confirm that the values in usagedata are regular with respect to time by using the isregular function.
% directforecaster requires data to be regularly sampled.
isregular(usagedata)

% Confirm that no values are missing in the time series by using the ismissing function.
sum(ismissing(usagedata))

% If your data is not regularly sampled or contains missing values, you can use the retime function or fill the missing values.
% For more information, see Clean Timetable with Missing, Duplicate, or Nonuniform Times.

%%% Prepare Data for Forecasting
% Before forecasting, reorganize the data.
% Use the date and time information in the usagedata timetable to create separate variables.
% Specifically, create Month, Day, Hour, WeekDay, DayOfYear, and WeekOfYear variables, and add them to the usagedata timetable.
usagedata.Month = month(usagedata.Time);
usagedata.Day = day(usagedata.Time);
usagedata.Hour = hour(usagedata.Time);
usagedata.WeekDay = weekday(usagedata.Time);
usagedata.DayOfYear = day(usagedata.Time,"dayofyear");
usagedata.WeekOfYear = week(usagedata.Time,"weekofyear");

% Normalize the time variables that contain more than 30 categories, so that their values are in the range â€“0.5 to 0.5.
% Specify the remaining time variables as categorical predictors.
[normData,C,S] = normalize( ...
    usagedata(:,["Day","DayOfYear","WeekOfYear"]),range=[-0.5 0.5]);
usagedata(:,["Day","DayOfYear","WeekOfYear"]) = normData;
catPredictors = ["Month","Hour","WeekDay"];

%%% Assess Performance at Specified Horizon Step
% Use holdout validation and expanding window cross-validation to assess the performance of a direct forecasting model that forecasts a fixed number of steps into the horizon.
% In this case, create and assess a model that forecasts 24 hours ahead.

%%% Holdout Validation
% Create a time series partition object using the tspartition function.
% Reserve 20% of the observations for testing and use the remaining observations for training.
% When you use holdout validation for time series data, the latest observations are in the test set and the oldest observations are in the training set.
holdoutPartition = tspartition(size(usagedata,1),"Holdout",0.2)

trainIdx = holdoutPartition.training;
testIdx = holdoutPartition.test;

% trainIdx and testIdx contain the indices for the observations in the training and test sets, respectively.

% Create a direct forecasting model by using the directforecaster function.
% Train the model using a boosted ensemble of regression trees.
% For the regression trees, specify the maximal number of decision splits (or branch nodes) per tree and the minimum number of observations per leaf by using the templateTree function.
% For the ensemble, specify to perform least-squares boosting with 150 trees and a learning rate of 0.2 for shrinkage by using the templateEnsemble function.

% Use the training set indices trainIdx to specify the training observations in usagedata.
% Specify the horizon step as 24 hours ahead.
% Specify the categorical and leading exogenous predictors.
% Note that all the exogenous predictors are leading because their future values are known.
% By default, directforecaster uses the unshifted leading exogenous predictors to train the direct forecasting model.
% Create 23 new predictors from the lagged values of the response variable Electricity.

% To see the prepared test data used by singleHoldoutModel to make predictions, you can use the preparedPredictors object function.
preparedPredictors(singleHoldoutModel,usagedata(testIdx,:));

% Use the helper function computeRRSE (shown at the end of this example) to compute the root relative squared error (RRSE) on the test data.
% The RRSE indicates how well a model performs relative to the simple model, which always predicts the average of the true values.
% In particular, when the RRSE is less than 1, the model performs better than the simple model.
% For more information, see Compute Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE).

% The singleHoldoutRRSE value indicates that the singleHoldoutModel performs well on the test data.

%%% Expanding Window Cross-Validation
% Create an object that partitions the time series observations using expanding windows.
% Split the data set into 5 windows with expanding training sets and fixed-size test sets by using tspartition.
% For each window, use at least one year of observations for training.
% By default, tspartition ensures that the latest observations are included in the last (fifth) window.
expandingWindowCV = tspartition(size(usagedata,1),"ExpandingWindow",5, ...
    MinTrainSize=366*24)

% The training observations in the first window are included in the second window, the training observations in the second window are included in the third window, and so on.
% For each window, the test observations follow the training observations in time.

% Create a cross-validated direct forecasting model by using the directforecaster function and the expandingWindowCV partition object.
% For each window, use the training observations to fit a boosted ensemble of regression trees.
% Specify the same model parameters used to create the model singleHoldoutModel.

    LossFun=@computeRRSE,Mode="individual")

singleCVRRSE = cvloss(singleExpandingCVModel, ...

% The average RRSE value returned by expanding window cross-validation (singleCVRRSE) is relatively low and is similar to the RRSE value returned by holdout validation (singleHoldoutRRSE).
% These results indicate that the forecasting model generally performs well.

%%% Assess Performance at Multiple Horizon Steps
% Use holdout validation and sliding window cross-validation to assess the performance of a direct forecasting model that forecasts at multiple horizon steps.
% In this case, create and assess a model that forecasts 1 to 24 hours ahead.

%%% Holdout Validation
% Reuse the time series partition object holdoutPartition for holdout validation.
% Recall that the object reserves 20% of the observations for testing and uses the remaining observations for training.

% Create a direct forecasting model by using the directforecaster function.
% For each horizon step, the function uses the training observations to fit a boosted ensemble of regression trees.

% As the horizon increases, the RRSE values stabilize to a relatively low value.
% This result indicates that the direct forecasting model predicts well for any time horizon between 1 and 24 hours.

%%% Sliding Window Cross-Validation
% Create an object that partitions the time series observations using sliding windows.
% Split the data set into 5 windows with fixed-size training and test sets by using tspartition.
% For each window, use at least one year of observations for training.
% By default, tspartition ensures that the latest observations are included in the last (fifth) window.
% Therefore, some older observations might be omitted from the cross-validation.
slidingWindowCV = tspartition(size(usagedata,1),"SlidingWindow",5, ...
    TrainSize=366*24)

% For each window, the test observations follow the training observations in time.

% For each window and horizon step, the function uses the training observations to fit a boosted ensemble of regression trees.
% Specify the same model parameters used to create the model singleHoldoutModel.
% However, to speed up training, use fewer trees (50) in each ensemble, and bin the numeric predictors.
% To further speed up the training process, set UseParallel to true and run computations in parallel.
% Parallel computation requires Parallel Computing Toolboxâ„¢.

% As the horizon increases, the RRSE values stabilize to a relatively low value.

% This discrepancy might be due to the difference in the number of training observations used in the sliding window and holdout validation schemes.
