% This example shows how to:
% - Create a single model that forecasts a fixed number of steps (24 hours) into the horizon. Use holdout validation and expanding window cross-validation to assess the performance of the model.
% - Create multiple models for different look-ahead horizons (1-24 hours) as described in [2]. Each of the 24 models forecasts a different hour into the horizon. Use holdout validation and sliding window cross-validation to assess the performance of the models.
% - Create multiple models to forecast into the next 24 hours beyond the available data.
% For an example that shows how to perform direct forecasting with the directforecaster function, see Perform Time Series Direct Forecasting with directforecaster.
% When you use directforecaster, you do not need to manually create lagged predictor variables or separate regression models for the specified horizon steps.

%%% Load and Visualize Data
% In this example, use electricity consumption data to create forecasting models.
% Load the data in electricityclient.mat, which is a subset of the ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014 data set available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1].
% The original data set contains the electricity consumption (in kWh) of 321 clients, logged every 15 minutes from 2012 to 2014, as described in [3].
% The smaller usagedata timetable contains the hourly electricity consumption of the sixth client only.
load electricityclient.mat

% Plot the electricity consumption of the sixth client during the first 200 hours.
% Overall, the electricity consumption of this client shows a periodicity of 24 hours.

% Confirm that the values in usagedata are regular with respect to time by using the isregular function.
% For you to use past values of the data as features or predictors, your data must be regularly sampled.
isregular(usagedata)

% Confirm that no values are missing in the time series by using the ismissing function.
sum(ismissing(usagedata))

% If your data is not regularly sampled or contains missing values, you can use the retime function or fill the missing values.
% For more information, see Clean Timetable with Missing, Duplicate, or Nonuniform Times.

%%% Prepare Data for Forecasting
% Before forecasting, reorganize the data.
% In particular, create separate time-related variables, lag features, and a response variable for each look-ahead horizon.

% Use the date and time information in the usagedata timetable to create separate variables.
% Specifically, create Month, Day, Hour, WeekDay, DayOfYear, and WeekOfYear variables, and add them to the usagedata timetable.
% Let numVar indicate the number of variables in usagedata.
usagedata.Month = month(usagedata.Time);

% Create lag features to use as predictors by using the lag function.
% That is, create 23 new variables, ElectricityLag1 through ElectricityLag23, where the lag number indicates the number of steps the Electricity data is shifted backward in time.
% Use the synchronize function to append the new variables to the usagedata timetable and create the dataWithLags timetable.

% Prepare the response variables for the look-ahead horizons 1 through 24.
