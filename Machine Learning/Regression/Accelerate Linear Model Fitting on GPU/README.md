# **Accelerate Linear Model Fitting on GPU**

Accelerate regression model fitting by running functions on a graphical processing unit (GPU). The example compares the time required to fit a model on a central processing unit (CPU) with the time required to fit the same model on a GPU. Using a GPU requires Parallel Computing Toolboxâ„¢ and a supported GPU device. For information about supported devices, see GPU Computing Requirements.
