# **Pitfalls in Fitting Nonlinear Models by Transforming to Linearity**

Pitfalls that can occur when fitting a nonlinear model by transforming to linearity. Imagine that we have collected measurements on two variables, x and y, and we want to model y as a function of x. Assume that x is measured exactly, while measurements of y are affected by additive, symmetric, zero-mean errors.
