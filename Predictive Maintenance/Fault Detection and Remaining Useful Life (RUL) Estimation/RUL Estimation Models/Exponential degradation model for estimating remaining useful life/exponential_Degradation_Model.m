%% Exponential degradation model for estimating remaining useful life

%%% Description
% Use exponentialDegradationModel to model an exponential degradation process for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of a component. 
% Degradation models estimate the RUL by predicting when a monitored signal will cross a predefined threshold. 
% Exponential degradation models are useful when the component experiences cumulative degradation. 
% For more information on the degradation model, see Exponential Degradation Model.

% To configure an exponentialDegradationModel object for a specific type of component, you can:
% - Estimate the model parameters using historical data regarding the health of an ensemble of similar components, such as multiple machines manufactured to the same specifications. To do so, use fit.
% - Specify the model parameters when you create the model based on your knowledge of the component degradation process.

% Once you configure the parameters of your degradation model, you can then predict the remaining useful life of similar components using predictRUL. 
% For a basic example illustrating RUL prediction with a degradation model, see Update RUL Prediction as Data Arrives.

% For general information on predicting remaining useful life, see Models for Predicting Remaining Useful Life.

%% Examples
%%% Train Exponential Degradation Model
% Load training data.

load('expTrainVectors.mat')

% The training data is a cell array of column vectors. 
% Each column vector is a degradation feature profile for a component.
% Create an exponential degradation model with default settings.

mdl = exponentialDegradationModel;

% Train the degradation model using the training data.

fit(mdl,expTrainVectors)

%% Create Exponential Degradation Model with Known Priors
% Create an exponential degradation model, and configure it with a known prior distribution.

mdl = exponentialDegradationModel('Theta',0.5,'ThetaVariance',0.003,...
                                  'Beta',0.3,'BetaVariance',0.002,...
                                  'Rho',0.1);

% The specified prior distribution parameters are stored in the Prior property of the model.

mdl.Prior

% The current posterior distribution of the model is also set to match the specified prior distribution. 
% For example, check the posterior value of the correlation parameter.

mdl.Rho 

%% Train Exponential Degradation Model Using Tabular Data
% Load training data.

load('expTrainTables.mat')

% The training data is a cell array of tables. 
% Each table is a degradation feature profile for a component. 
% Each profile consists of life time measurements in the "Time" variable and corresponding degradation feature measurements in the "Condition" variable.
% Create a exponential degradation model with default settings.

mdl = exponentialDegradationModel;

% Train the degradation model using the training data. Specify the names of the life time and data variables.

fit(mdl,expTrainTables,"Time","Condition")

%% Predict RUL Using Exponential Degradation Model
% Load training data.

load('expTrainTables.mat')

% The training data is a cell array of tables. 
% Each table is a degradation feature profile for a component. 
% Each profile consists of life time measurements in the "Hours" variable and corresponding degradation feature measurements in the "Condition" variable.
% Create an exponential degradation model, specifying the life time variable units.

mdl = exponentialDegradationModel('LifeTimeUnit',"hours");

% Train the degradation model using the training data. 
% Specify the names of the life time and data variables.

fit(mdl,expTrainTables,"Time","Condition")

% Load testing data, which is a run-to-failure degradation profile for a test component. 
% The test data is a table with the same life time and data variables as the training data.

load('expTestData.mat')

% Based on knowledge of the degradation feature limits, define a threshold condition indicator value that indicates the end-of-life of a component.

threshold = 500;

% Assume that you measure the component condition indicator every hour for 150 hours. 
% Update the trained degradation model with each measurement. 
% Then, predict the remaining useful life of the component at 150 hours. 
% The RUL is the forecasted time at which the degradation feature will pass the specified threshold.

for t = 1:150 
 update(mdl,expTestData(t,:)) 
end 
estRUL = predictRUL(mdl,threshold)

% The estimated RUL is around 137 hours, which indicates a total predicted life span of 287 hours.

%% Update Exponential Degradation Model and Predict RUL
% Load observation data.

load('expTestData.mat')

% For this example, assume that the training data is not historical data, but rather real-time observations of the component condition.
% Based on knowledge of the degradation feature limits, define a threshold condition indicator value that indicates the end-of-life of a component.

threshold = 500;

% Create an exponential degradation model arbitrary prior distribution data and a specified noise variance. 
% Also, specify the life time and data variable names for the observation data.

mdl = exponentialDegradationModel('Theta',1,'ThetaVariance',1e6,...
                                  'Beta',1,'BetaVariance',1e6,...
                                  'NoiseVariance',0.003,...
                                  'LifeTimeVariable',"Time",'DataVariables',"Condition",...
                                  'LifeTimeUnit',"hours");

% Observe the component condition for 100 hours, updating the degradation model after each observation.

for i=1:100
    update(mdl,expTestData(i,:));
end

% After 100 hours, predict the RUL of the component using the current life time value stored in the model. 
% Also, obtain the confidence interval associated with the estimated RUL.

estRUL = predictRUL(mdl,threshold)

% The estimated RUL is about 234 hours, which indicates a total predicted life span of 334 hours.
