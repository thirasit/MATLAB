%% RPM Profile of Vibration Signal
% Generate a vibration signal with three harmonic components. The signal is sampled at 1 kHz for 16 seconds. The signal's instantaneous frequency resembles the runup and coastdown of an engine. Compute the instantaneous phase by integrating the frequency using the trapezoidal rule.
fs = 1000;
t = 0:1/fs:16;

ifq = 20 + t.^6.*exp(-t);
phi = 2*pi*cumtrapz(t,ifq);

% The harmonic components of the signal correspond to orders 1, 2, and 3. The order-2 sinusoid has twice the amplitude of the others.
ol = [1 2 3];
amp = [5 10 5];

vib = amp*cos(ol'.*phi);

% Extract and visualize the RPM profile of the signal using a point on the order-2 ridge.

%% RPM Profile of Revving Engine
% Generate a signal that resembles the vibrations caused by revving a car engine. 
% The signal is sampled at 1 kHz for 30 seconds and contains three harmonic components of orders 1, 2.4, and 3, with amplitudes 5, 4, and 0.5, respectively. 
% Embed the signal in unit-variance white Gaussian noise and store it in a MATLABÂ® timetable. 
% Multiply the instantaneous frequency by 60 to obtain an RPM profile. 
% Plot the RPM profile.

%% Fan Switchoff RPM Profile
% Estimate the RPM profile of a fan blade as it slows down after switchoff.

% An industrial roof fan spinning at 20,000 rpm is turned off. 
% Air resistance (with a negligible contribution from bearing friction) causes the fan rotor to stop in approximately 6 seconds. 
% A high-speed camera measures the x-coordinate of one of the fan blades at a rate of 1 kHz.
fs = 1000;
t = 0:1/fs:6-1/fs;

% Idealize the fan blade as a point mass circling the rotor center at a radius of 50 cm. The blade experiences a drag force proportional to speed, resulting in the following expression for the phase angle
