%% Generate a MATLAB Function in Diagnostic Feature Designer

% In Diagnostic Feature Designer, you explore features interactively, using tools for signal processing, feature generation, and ranking. 
% Once you select the set of the features that perform best, you can generate a MATLABÂ® function that reproduces the calculations for those features. 
% You can apply this function directly to a larger set of measurement data and increase the number of members in your feature set. 
% You can also modify the function to suit your application, and incorporate part or all of the function into other code.

% This example shows how to generate a MATLAB function to compute a set of features, and how to validate that function with the original data set.

% The example assumes that you are familiar with ensemble data concepts and with basic operations in the app, such as data import, signal processing, and feature generation. 
% For more information on these concepts and operations, see Identify Condition Indicators for Predictive Maintenance Algorithm Design.

%%% Import the Transmission Model Data
% This example uses ensemble data generated from a transmission system model in Using Simulink to Generate Fault Data. Outputs of the model include:
% - Vibration measurements from a sensor monitoring casing vibrations
% - Tachometer sensor, which issues a pulse every time the shaft completes a rotation
% - Fault code indicating the presence of a modeled fault
% In your MATLAB command window, load the transmission data, which is stored in the table dataTable.

load dfd_Tutorial dataTable

% dataTable is an ensemble table that contains 16 members, each of which represents one simulated transmission system. 
% Each row of the table corresponds to one member. 
% Each column of the table corresponds to one variable, such as Vibration or FaultCode. 
% All ensemble members have the same variables.

% Open Diagnostic Feature Designer.

diagnosticFeatureDesigner

% In the app, import dataTable. 
% During the import process, set the faultCode type to a condition variable. 
% When the import is complete, the Signals list in the Variables pane displays the vibration and tacho data. 
% For information on the import process, see Import and Visualize Ensemble Data in Diagnostic Feature Designer.

%%% Compute a TSA Signal
% Compute a time-synchronous average (TSA) signal from your vibration and tacho signals. 
% To do so, first select Vibration/Data in the Variables pane. 
% Then, in the Feature Designer tab, select Filtering & Averaging > Time-Synchronous Averaging. 
% Set the parameters as shown in the following figure and click OK.

% The new signal appears in the Variables pane.

% For information on TSA signals, see tsa.

%%% Extract Features from the TSA Signal
% In the Variables pane, select the TSA signal. 
% Then, in the Feature Designer tab, select Time-Domain Features > Signal Features to open the set of available signal features. 
% Select the features for Mean, Standard Deviation, and Kurtosis.

imshow("dfd-cg-ex1-signal-features.png")

% View the feature values. In the Variables pane, select FeatureTable1. 
% Then, in the plot gallery, click Feature Table View. 
% These steps open a table containing the feature values for each member along with the condition variable faultCode.

%%% Generate a MATLAB Function
% Generate a MATLAB function that reproduces the calculations for these features. 
% In the Feature Designer tab, select Export > Generate Function for Features.

figure
imshow("dfd-cg-ex1-select-generate-function_features.png")

% Your selection opens a dialog box that allows you to specify the feature table and the features. 
% Because you have performed no ranking, the app configures the dialog box to export all three features.

imshow("dfd-cg-ex1-generate-function-features.png")

%%% Validate Function with the Original Data
% Run the function using dataTable to create a new feature table featuretable.

featuretable = diagnosticFeatures(dataTable)

% Compare the first eight feature values to the corresponding feature values in the app. At the level of the displayed precision, the values are identical.
