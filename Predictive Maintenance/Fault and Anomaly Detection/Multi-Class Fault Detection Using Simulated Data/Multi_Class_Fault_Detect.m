%% Multi-Class Fault Detection Using Simulated Data

% This example shows how to use a SimulinkÂ® model to generate fault and healthy data. 
% The data is used to develop a multi-class classifier to detect different combinations of faults. 
% The example uses a triplex reciprocating pump model and includes leak, blocking, and bearing faults.

%%% Setup the Model
% This example uses many supporting files that are stored in a zip file. 
% Unzip the file to get access to the supporting files, load the model parameters, and create the reciprocating pump library.

if ~exist('+mech_hydro_forcesPS','dir')
    unzip('pdmRecipPump_supportingfiles.zip')
end

% Load Parameters

% Create Simscape library if needed

%%% Reciprocating Pump Model
% The reciprocating pump consists of an electric motor, the pump housing, pump crank and pump plungers.

% The pump model is configured to model three types of faults; cylinder leaks, blocked inlet, and increased bearing friction. 
% These faults are parameterized as workspace variables and configured through the pump block dialog.

%%% Simulating Fault and Healthy Data
% For each of the three fault types create an array of values that represent the fault severity, ranging from no fault to a significant fault.

% Define fault parameter variations
numParValues = 10;
leak_area_set_factor = linspace(0.00,0.036,numParValues);
leak_area_set = leak_area_set_factor*TRP_Par.Check_Valve.In.Max_Area;
leak_area_set = max(leak_area_set,1e-9); % Leakage area cannot be 0
blockinfactor_set = linspace(0.8,0.53,numParValues);
bearingfactor_set = linspace(0,6e-4,numParValues);

% The pump model is configured to include noise, thus running the model with the same fault parameter values will result in different simulation outputs. 
% This is useful for developing a classifier as it means there can be multiple simulation results for the same fault condition and severity. 
% To configure simulations for such results, create vectors of fault parameter values where the values represent no faults, a single fault, combinations of two faults, and combinations of three faults. 
% For each group (no fault, single fault, etc.) create 125 combinations of fault values from the fault parameter values defined above. 
% This gives a total of 1000 combinations of fault parameter values. 
% Note that running these 1000 simulations in parallel takes around an hour on a standard desktop and generates around 620MB of data. 
% To reduce simulation time, reduce the number of fault combinations to 20 by changing runAll = true to runAll = false. 
% Note that a larger dataset results in a more robust classifier.

% Set number of elements in each fault group
runAll = true; 
if runAll
    % Create a large dataset to build a robust classifier
    nPerGroup = 100;

    % Create a smaller dataset to reduce simulation time

% The flow spectrum reveals resonant peaks at expected frequencies. 
% Specifically, the pump motor speed is 950 rpm, or 15.833 Hz, and since the pump has 3 cylinders the flow is expected to have a fundamental at 3*15.833 Hz, or 47.5 Hz, as well as harmonics at multiples of 47.5 Hz. 
% The flow spectrum clearly shows the expected resonant peaks. 
% Faults in one cylinder of the pump will result in resonances at the pump motor speed, 15.833 Hz and its harmonics.

% The confusion plot shows for each combination of faults the number of times the fault combination was correctly predicted (the diagonal entries of the plot) and the number of times the fault combination was incorrectly predicted (the off-diagonal entries).

% The confusion plot shows that the classifier did not correctly classify some fault conditions (the off diagonal terms). 
% However, the no fault condition was correctly predicted. 
% In a couple of places a no fault condition was predicted when there was a fault (the first column), otherwise a fault was predicted although it may not be exactly the correct fault condition.

% Plotting the spectrum for the case with a small blocking fault value and comparing with a fault free condition reveals that spectra are very similar making detection difficult. 
% Re-training the classifier but including a blocking value of 0.77 as a non fault condition would significantly improve the performance of the fault detector.

%%% Conclusion
% This example showed how to use a Simulink model to model faults in a reciprocating pump, simulate the model under different fault combinations and severities, extract condition indicators from the pump output flow and use the condition indicators to train a classifier to detect pump faults. 
% The example examined the performance of fault detection using the classifier and noted that small blocking faults are very similar to the no fault condition and cannot be reliably detected.
