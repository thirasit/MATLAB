function [featureTable,outputTable] = generateFeatures(inputData)
%DIAGNOSTICFEATURES recreates results in Diagnostic Feature Designer.
%
% Input:
%  inputData: A table or a cell array of tables/matrices containing the
%  data as those imported into the app.
%
% Output:
%  featureTable: A table containing all features and condition variables.
%  outputTable: A table containing the computation results.
%
% This function computes features:
%  ch1_stats/Col1_CrestFactor
%  ch1_stats/Col1_Kurtosis
%  ch1_stats/Col1_RMS
%  ch1_stats/Col1_Std
%  ch2_stats/Col1_Mean
%  ch2_stats/Col1_RMS
%  ch2_stats/Col1_Skewness
%  ch2_stats/Col1_Std
%  ch3_stats/Col1_CrestFactor
%  ch3_stats/Col1_SINAD
%  ch3_stats/Col1_SNR
%  ch3_stats/Col1_THD
%
% Organization of the function:
% 1. Compute signals/spectra/features
% 2. Extract computed features into a table
%
% Modify the function to add or remove data processing, feature generation
% or ranking operations.
