%% Color-Based Segmentation Using the L*a*b* Color Space
% This example shows how to identify different colors in fabric by analyzing the L*a*b* colorspace. The fabric image was acquired using the Image Acquisition Toolboxâ„¢.

%%% Step 1: Acquire Image
% Read in the fabric.png image, which is an image of colorful fabric. 
% Instead of using fabric.png, you can acquire an image using the following functions in the Image Acquisition Toolbox.
% Access a Matrox(R) frame grabber attached to a Pulnix TMC-9700 camera, and
% acquire data using an NTSC format.  
% vidobj = videoinput('matrox',1,'M_NTSC_RGB');

% Open a live preview window.  Point camera onto a piece of colorful fabric.
% preview(vidobj);

% Capture one frame of data.
% fabric = getsnapshot(vidobj);
% imwrite(fabric,'fabric.png','png');

% Delete and clear associated variables.
% delete(vidobj)
% clear vidobj;

fabric = imread('fabric.png');

%%% Step 2: Calculate Sample Colors in L*a*b* Color Space for Each Region
% You can see six major colors in the image: the background color, red, green, purple, yellow, and magenta. 
% Notice how easily you can visually distinguish these colors from one another. 
% The L*a*b* colorspace (also known as CIELAB or CIE L*a*b*) enables you to quantify these visual differences.

% The L*a*b* color space is derived from the CIE XYZ tristimulus values. 
% The L*a*b* space consists of a luminosity 'L*' or brightness layer, chromaticity layer 'a*' indicating where color falls along the red-green axis, and chromaticity layer 'b*' indicating where the color falls along the blue-yellow axis.

% Your approach is to choose a small sample region for each color and to calculate each sample region's average color in 'a*b*' space. 
% You will use these color markers to classify each pixel.

% To simplify this example, load the region coordinates that are stored in a MAT-file.
load regioncoordinates;

nColors = 6;
sample_regions = false([size(fabric,1) size(fabric,2) nColors]);

for count = 1:nColors
  sample_regions(:,:,count) = roipoly(fabric,region_coordinates(:,1,count), ...
                                      region_coordinates(:,2,count));
end

figure
imshow(sample_regions(:,:,2))
title('Sample Region for Red')

% Convert your fabric RGB image into an L*a*b* image using rgb2lab .
lab_fabric = rgb2lab(fabric);

% Calculate the mean 'a*' and 'b*' value for each area that you extracted with roipoly. 
% These values serve as your color markers in 'a*b*' space.
a = lab_fabric(:,:,2);
b = lab_fabric(:,:,3);
color_markers = zeros([nColors, 2]);

for count = 1:nColors
  color_markers(count,1) = mean2(a(sample_regions(:,:,count)));
  color_markers(count,2) = mean2(b(sample_regions(:,:,count)));
end

% For example, the average color of the red sample region in 'a*b*' space is
fprintf('[%0.3f,%0.3f] \n',color_markers(2,1),color_markers(2,2))

%%% Step 3: Classify Each Pixel Using the Nearest Neighbor Rule
% Each color marker now has an 'a*' and a 'b*' value. 
% You can classify each pixel in the lab_fabric image by calculating the Euclidean distance between that pixel and each color marker. 
% The smallest distance will tell you that the pixel most closely matches that color marker. 
% For example, if the distance between a pixel and the red color marker is the smallest, then the pixel would be labeled as a red pixel.

% Create an array that contains your color labels, i.e., 0 = background, 1 = red, 2 = green, 3 = purple, 4 = magenta, and 5 = yellow.
color_labels = 0:nColors-1;

% Initialize matrices to be used in the nearest neighbor classification.
a = double(a);
b = double(b);
distance = zeros([size(a), nColors]);

% Perform classification
for count = 1:nColors
  distance(:,:,count) = ( (a - color_markers(count,1)).^2 + ...
                      (b - color_markers(count,2)).^2 ).^0.5;
end

[~,label] = min(distance,[],3);
label = color_labels(label);
clear distance;

%%% Step 4: Display Results of Nearest Neighbor Classification
% The label matrix contains a color label for each pixel in the fabric image. 
% Use the label matrix to separate objects in the original fabric image by color.
rgb_label = repmat(label,[1 1 3]);
segmented_images = zeros([size(fabric), nColors],'uint8');

for count = 1:nColors
  color = fabric;
  color(rgb_label ~= color_labels(count)) = 0;
  segmented_images(:,:,:,count) = color;
end 

% Display the five segmented colors as a montage. 
% Also display the background pixels in the image that are not classified as a color.

    segmented_images(:,:,:,4),segmented_images(:,:,:,5) ...
    segmented_images(:,:,:,6),segmented_images(:,:,:,1)});
title("Montage of Red, Green, Purple, Magenta, and Yellow Objects, and Background")

%%% Step 5: Display 'a*' and 'b*' Values of the Labeled Colors
% You can see how well the nearest neighbor classification separated the different color populations by plotting the 'a*' and 'b*' values of pixels that were classified into separate colors. 
% For display purposes, label each point with its color label.
purple = [119/255 73/255 152/255];
plot_labels = {'k', 'r', 'g', purple, 'm', 'y'};

  plot(a(label==count-1),b(label==count-1),'.','MarkerEdgeColor', ...
       plot_labels{count}, 'MarkerFaceColor', plot_labels{count});
  hold on;
