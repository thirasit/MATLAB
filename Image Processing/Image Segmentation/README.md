# **Image Segmentation**

Determine region boundaries in an image using different approaches including automatic thresholding, edge-based methods, and morphology-based methods.

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into parts or regions. This division into parts is often based on the characteristics of the pixels in the image. For example, one way to find regions in an image is to look for abrupt discontinuities in pixel values, which typically indicate edges. These edges can define regions. Other methods divide the image into regions based on color values or texture.
