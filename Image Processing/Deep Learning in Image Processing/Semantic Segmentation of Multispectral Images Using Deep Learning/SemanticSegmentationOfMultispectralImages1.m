%% Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Images Using Deep Learning
% This example shows how to perform semantic segmentation of a multispectral image with seven channels using U-Net.

% Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class.
% One application of semantic segmentation is tracking deforestation, which is the change in forest cover over time.
% Environmental agencies track deforestation to assess and quantify the environmental and ecological health of a region.

% Deep learning based semantic segmentation can yield a precise measurement of vegetation cover from high-resolution aerial photographs.
% One challenge is differentiating classes with similar visual characteristics, such as trying to classify a green pixel as grass, shrubbery, or tree.
% To increase classification accuracy, some data sets contain multispectral images that provide additional information about each pixel.
% For example, the Hamlin Beach State Park data set supplements the color images with three near-infrared channels that provide a clearer separation of the classes.

% This example first shows you how to perform semantic segmentation using a pretrained U-Net and then use the segmentation results to calculate the extent of vegetation cover.
% Then, you can optionally train a U-Net network on the Hamlin Beach State Parck data set using a patch-based training methodology.

%%% Download Dataset
% This example uses a high-resolution multispectral data set to train the network [1].
% The image set was captured using a drone over the Hamlin Beach State Park, NY.
% The data contains labeled training, validation, and test sets, with 18 object class labels.
% The size of the data file is 3.0 GB.

% Download the MAT-file version of the data set using the downloadHamlinBeachMSIData helper function.
% This function is attached to the example as a supporting file.
% Specify dataDir as the desired location of the data.
dataDir = fullfile(tempdir,"rit18_data");

% The multispectral image data is arranged as numChannels-by-width-by-height arrays.
% However, in MATLABÂ®, multichannel images are arranged as width-by-height-by-numChannels arrays.
% To reshape the data so that the channels are in the third dimension, use the switchChannelsToThirdPlane helper function.
% This function is attached to the example as a supporting file.
train_data = switchChannelsToThirdPlane(train_data);
val_data   = switchChannelsToThirdPlane(val_data);
test_data  = switchChannelsToThirdPlane(test_data);

% Confirm that the data has the correct structure.

%%% Visualize Multispectral Data
% In this dataset, the RGB color channels are the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st image channels.
% Display the color component of the training, validation, and test images as a montage.
% To make the images appear brighter on the screen, equalize their histograms by using the histeq function.

%%% Calculate Extent of Vegetation Cover
% The semantic segmentation results can be used to answer pertinent ecological questions.
% For example, what percentage of land area is covered by vegetation?
% To answer this question, find the number of pixels labeled vegetation.
% The label IDs 2 ("Trees"), 13 ("LowLevelVegetation"), and 14 ("Grass_Lawn") are the vegetation classes.
% Also find the total number of valid pixels by summing the pixels in the ROI of the mask image.
vegetationClassIds = uint8([2,13,14]);
vegetationPixels = ismember(segmentedImage(:),vegetationClassIds);
validPixels = (segmentedImage~=0);

numVegetationPixels = sum(vegetationPixels(:));
numValidPixels = sum(validPixels(:));

% Calculate the percentage of vegetation cover by dividing the number of vegetation pixels by the number of valid pixels.
percentVegetationCover = (numVegetationPixels/numValidPixels)*100;
fprintf("The percentage of vegetation cover is %3.2f%%.",percentVegetationCover);

% The rest of the example shows you how to train U-Net on the Hamlin Beach dataset.

%%% Create Random Patch Extraction Datastore for Training
% Use a random patch extraction datastore to feed the training data to the network.
% This datastore extracts multiple corresponding random patches from an image datastore and pixel label datastore that contain ground truth images and pixel label data.
% Patching is a common technique to prevent running out of memory for large images and to effectively increase the amount of available training data.

% Begin by loading the training images from "train_data.mat" in an imageDatastore.
% Because the MAT file format is a nonstandard image format, you must use a MAT file reader to enable reading the image data.
% You can use the helper MAT file reader, matRead6Channels, that extracts the first six channels from the training data and omits the last channel containing the mask.
% This function is attached to the example as a supporting file.
imds = imageDatastore("train_data.mat",FileExtensions=".mat",ReadFcn=@matRead6Channels);

% Create a pixelLabelDatastore (Computer Vision Toolbox) to store the label patches containing the 18 labeled regions.
pixelLabelIds = 1:18;
pxds = pixelLabelDatastore("train_labels.png",classNames,pixelLabelIds);

% Create a randomPatchExtractionDatastore from the image datastore and the pixel label datastore.
% Each mini-batch contains 16 patches of size 256-by-256 pixels.
% One thousand mini-batches are extracted at each iteration of the epoch.
dsTrain = randomPatchExtractionDatastore(imds,pxds,[256,256],PatchesPerImage=16000);

% The random patch extraction datastore dsTrain provides mini-batches of data to the network at each iteration of the epoch.
% Preview the datastore to explore the data.
inputBatch = preview(dsTrain);
disp(inputBatch)

%%% Create U-Net Network Layers
% This example uses a variation of the U-Net network.
% In U-Net, the initial series of convolutional layers are interspersed with max pooling layers, successively decreasing the resolution of the input image.
% These layers are followed by a series of convolutional layers interspersed with upsampling operators, successively increasing the resolution of the input image [2].
% The name U-Net comes from the fact that the network can be drawn with a symmetric shape like the letter U.

% This example modifies the U-Net to use zero-padding in the convolutions, so that the input and the output to the convolutions have the same size.
% Use the helper function, createUnet, to create a U-Net with a few preselected hyperparameters.
% This function is attached to the example as a supporting file.
inputTileSize = [256,256,6];
lgraph = createUnet(inputTileSize);

%%% Select Training Options
% Train the network using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) optimization.
% Specify the hyperparameter settings for SGDM by using the trainingOptions (Deep Learning Toolbox) function.

% Training a deep network is time-consuming.
% Accelerate the training by specifying a high learning rate.
% However, this can cause the gradients of the network to explode or grow uncontrollably, preventing the network from training successfully.
% To keep the gradients in a meaningful range, enable gradient clipping by specifying "GradientThreshold" as 0.05, and specify "GradientThresholdMethod" to use the L2-norm of the gradients.
initialLearningRate = 0.05;
maxEpochs = 150;
minibatchSize = 16;
l2reg = 0.0001;

options = trainingOptions("sgdm",...

%%% Train the Network or Download Pretrained Network
% To train the network, set the doTraining variable in the following code to true.
% Train the model by using the trainNetwork (Deep Learning Toolbox) function.

% Train on a GPU if one is available.
% Using a GPU requires Parallel Computing Toolboxâ¢ and a CUDAÂ® enabled NVIDIAÂ® GPU.
% For more information, see GPU Computing Requirements (Parallel Computing Toolbox).
% Training takes about 20 hours on an NVIDIA Titan X.

%%% Evaluate Segmentation Accuracy
% Segment the validation data.
segmentedImage = segmentMultispectralImage(val_data,net,predictPatchSize);

% Save the segmented image and ground truth labels as PNG files.
% The example uses these files to calculate accuracy metrics.
imwrite(segmentedImage,"results.png");
imwrite(val_labels,"gtruth.png");

% Load the segmentation results and ground truth using pixelLabelDatastore (Computer Vision Toolbox).
pxdsResults = pixelLabelDatastore("results.png",classNames,pixelLabelIds);
pxdsTruth = pixelLabelDatastore("gtruth.png",classNames,pixelLabelIds);

% Measure the global accuracy of the semantic segmentation by using the evaluateSemanticSegmentation (Computer Vision Toolbox) function.
ssm = evaluateSemanticSegmentation(pxdsResults,pxdsTruth,Metrics="global-accuracy");

% The global accuracy score indicates that just over 90% of the pixels are classified correctly.
