%% Deflection Analysis of Bracket
% This example shows how to analyze a 3-D mechanical part under an applied load using finite element analysis (FEA) and determine the maximal deflection.

%%% Create Structural Analysis Model
% The first step in solving a linear elasticity problem is to create a structural analysis model.
% This model is a container that holds the geometry, structural material properties, damping parameters, body loads, boundary loads, boundary constraints, superelement interfaces, initial displacement and velocity, and mesh.
model = createpde("structural","static-solid");

%%% Import Geometry
% Import an STL file of a simple bracket model using the importGeometry function.
% This function reconstructs the faces, edges, and vertices of the model.
% It can merge some faces and edges, so the numbers can differ from those of the parent CAD model.
importGeometry(model,"BracketWithHole.stl");

% Plot the geometry, displaying face labels.

pdegplot(model,"FaceLabels","on")

%%% Specify Structural Properties of Material
% Specify Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the material.
structuralProperties(model,"YoungsModulus",200e9, ...
                           "PoissonsRatio",0.3);

%%% Apply Boundary Conditions and Loads
% The problem has two boundary conditions: the back face (face 4) is fixed, and the front face (face 8) has an applied load.
% All other boundary conditions, by default, are free boundaries.
structuralBC(model,"Face",4,"Constraint","fixed");

% Apply a distributed load in the negative z-direction to the front face.
structuralBoundaryLoad(model,"Face",8,"SurfaceTraction",[0;0;-1e4]);

%%% Generate Mesh
% Generate and plot a mesh.
generateMesh(model);

%%% Calculate Solution
% Use the solve function to calculate the solution.
result = solve(model)

%%% Examine Solution
% Find the maximal deflection of the bracket in the z-direction.
minUz = min(result.Displacement.uz);
fprintf("Maximal deflection in the z-direction is %g meters.", minUz)

%%% Plot Results Using Visualize PDE Results Live Editor Task
% Visualize the displacement components and the von Mises stress by using the Visualize PDE Results Live Editor task.
% The maximal deflections are in the z-direction.
% Because the bracket and the load are symmetric, the x-displacement and z-displacement are symmetric, and the y-displacement is antisymmetric with respect to the center line.

% First, create a new live script by clicking the New Live Script button in the File section on the Home tab.

% To plot the z-displacement, follow these steps. To plot the x- and y-displacements, follow the same steps, but set Component to X and Y, respectively.
% 1. In the Select results section of the task, select result from the drop-down list.
% 2. In the Specify data parameters section of the task, set Type to Displacement and Component to Z.
% 3. In the Specify visualization parameters section of the task, clear the Deformation check box.

% Here, the blue color represents the lowest displacement value, and the red color represents the highest displacement value.
% The bracket load causes face 8 to dip down, so the maximum z-displacement appears blue.

%%% Plot Results at the Command Line
% You also can plot the results, such as the displacement components and the von Mises stress, at the MATLABÂ® command line by using the pdeplot3D function.
