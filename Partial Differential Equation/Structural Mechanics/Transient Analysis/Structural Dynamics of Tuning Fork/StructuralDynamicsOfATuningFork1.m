%% Structural Dynamics of Tuning Fork
% Perform modal and transient analysis of a tuning fork.

% A tuning fork is a U-shaped beam.
% When struck on one of its prongs or tines, it vibrates at its fundamental (first) frequency and produces an audible sound.

% The first flexible mode of a tuning fork is characterized by symmetric vibration of the tines: they move towards and away from each other simultaneously, balancing the forces at the base where they intersect.
% The fundamental mode of vibration does not produce any bending effect on the handle attached at the intersection of tines.
% The lack of bending at the base enables easy handling of tuning fork without influencing its dynamics.

% Transverse vibration of the tines causes the handle to vibrate axially at the fundamental frequency.
% This axial vibration can be used to amplify the audible sound by bringing the end of the handle in contact with a larger surface area, like a metal table top.
% The next higher mode with symmetric mode shape is about 6.25 times the fundamental frequency.
% Therefore, a properly excited tuning fork tends to vibrate with a dominant frequency corresponding to fundamental frequency, producing a pure audible tone.
% This example simulates these aspects of the tuning fork dynamics by performing a modal analysis and a transient dynamics simulation.

% You can find the helper functions animateSixTuningForkModes and tuningForkFFT and the geometry file TuningFork.stl under matlab/R20XXx/examples/pde/main.

%%% Modal Analysis of Tuning Fork
% Find natural frequencies and mode shapes for the fundamental mode of a tuning fork and the next several modes.
% Show the lack of bending effect on the fork handle at the fundamental frequency.
% First, create a structural model for modal analysis of a solid tuning fork.
model = createpde("structural","modal-solid");

% To perform unconstrained modal analysis of a structure, it is enough to specify geometry, mesh, and material properties.
% First, import and plot the tuning fork geometry.
importGeometry(model,"TuningFork.stl");

% Generate a mesh.
generateMesh(model,"Hmax",0.001);

% Solve the model for a chosen frequency range.
% Specify the lower frequency limit below zero so that all modes with frequencies near zero appear in the solution.
RF = solve(model,"FrequencyRange",[-1,4000]*2*pi);

% By default, the solver returns circular frequencies.
modeID = 1:numel(RF.NaturalFrequencies);

% Express the resulting frequencies in Hz by dividing them by 2Ï€.
% Display the frequencies in a table.
tmodalResults = table(modeID.',RF.NaturalFrequencies/2/pi);
tmodalResults.Properties.VariableNames = {'Mode','Frequency'};
disp(tmodalResults);

% Because there are no boundary constraints in this example, modal results include the rigid body modes.
% The first six near-zero frequencies indicate the six rigid body modes of a 3-D solid body.
% The first flexible mode is the seventh mode with a frequency around 460 Hz.

% The best way to visualize mode shapes is to animate the harmonic motion at their respective frequencies.
% The animateSixTuningForkModes function animates the six flexible modes, which are modes 7 through 12 in the modal results RF.
frames  = animateSixTuningForkModes(RF);

% To play the animation, use the following command:
% movie(figure("units","normalized","outerposition",[0 0 1 1]),frames,5,30)
% In the first mode, two oscillating tines of the tuning fork balance out transverse forces at the handle.
% The next mode with this effect is the fifth flexible mode with the frequency 2906.5 Hz.
% This frequency is about 6.25 times greater than the fundamental frequency 460 Hz.

%%% Transient Analysis of Tuning Fork
% Simulate the dynamics of a tuning fork being gently and quickly struck on one of its tines.
% Analyze vibration of tines over time and axial vibration of the handle.

% First, create a structural transient analysis model.

% Impose sufficient boundary constraints to prevent rigid body motion under applied loading.

% Approximate an impulse loading on a face of a tine by applying a pressure load for a very small fraction of the time period of the fundamental mode.
