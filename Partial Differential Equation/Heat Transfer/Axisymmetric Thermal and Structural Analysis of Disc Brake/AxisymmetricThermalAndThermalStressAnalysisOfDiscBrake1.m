%% Axisymmetric Thermal and Structural Analysis of Disc Brake
% This example shows a quasistatic axisymmetric thermal stress analysis workflow by reproducing the results of the simplified disc brake model discussed in [1].
% Disc brakes absorb mechanical energy through friction and transform it into thermal energy, which then dissipates.
% The example uses a simplified model of a disc brake in a single braking process from a constant initial angular speed to a standstill.
% The workflow has two steps:

% 1. Transient thermal analysis to compute the temperature distribution in the disc using the heat flux from brake pads
% 2. Quasistatic structural analysis to compute thermal stresses at several solution times using previously obtained temperature distribution to specify thermal loads

% The resulting plots show the temperature distribution, radial stress, hoop stress, and von Mises stress for the corresponding solution times.

%%% Disc Brake Properties and Geometry
% Based on the assumptions used in [1], the example reduces the analysis domain to a rectangular region corresponding to the axisymmetric section of the annular disc.
% Because of the geometric and load symmetry of the disc, the example models only half the thickness of the disc and the effect of one pad.
% In the following figure, the left edge corresponds to the inner radius of the disc r_d.
% The right edge corresponds to the outer radius of the disc R_d and also coincides with the outer radius of the pad R_p.
% The disc experiences pressure from the pad, which generates the heat flux.
% Instead of modeling the pad explicitly, include its effect in the thermal analysis by specifying this heat flux as a boundary condition from the inner radius of the pad r_p to the outer radius of the pad R_p.
