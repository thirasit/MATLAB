%% Heat Transfer in Block with Cavity
% This example shows how to solve for the heat distribution in a block with cavity.

% Consider a block containing a rectangular crack or cavity.
% The left side of the block is heated to 100 degrees centigrade.
% At the right side of the block, heat flows from the block to the surrounding air at a constant rate, for example âˆ’10W/m^2.
% All the other boundaries are insulated.
% The temperature in the block at the starting time t_0=0 is 0 degrees.
% The goal is to model the heat distribution during the first five seconds.

%%% Create Thermal Analysis Model
% The first step in solving a heat transfer problem is to create a thermal analysis model.
% This is a container that holds the geometry, thermal material properties, internal heat sources, temperature on the boundaries, heat fluxes through the boundaries, mesh, and initial conditions.
thermalmodel = createpde("thermal","transient");

%%% Import Geometry
% Add the block geometry to the thermal model by using the geometryFromEdges function.
% The geometry description file for this problem is called crackg.m.
geometryFromEdges(thermalmodel,@crackg);

% Plot the geometry, displaying edge labels.

%%% Specify Thermal Properties of Material
% Specify the thermal conductivity, mass density, and specific heat of the material.

%%% Apply Boundary Conditions
% Specify the temperature on the left edge as 100, and constant heat flow to the exterior through the right edge as -10.
% The toolbox uses the default insulating boundary condition for all other boundaries.
thermalBC(thermalmodel,"Edge",6,"Temperature",100);
thermalBC(thermalmodel,"Edge",1,"HeatFlux",-10);

%%% Set Initial Conditions
% Set an initial value of 0 for the temperature.
thermalIC(thermalmodel,0);

%%% Generate Mesh
% Create and plot a mesh.
generateMesh(thermalmodel);

%%% Specify Solution Times
% Set solution times to be 0 to 5 seconds in steps of 1/2.
tlist = 0:0.5:5;

%%% Calculate Solution
% Use the solve function to calculate the solution.
thermalresults = solve(thermalmodel,tlist)

%%% Evaluate Heat Flux
% Compute the heat flux density.
[qx,qy] = evaluateHeatFlux(thermalresults);

%%% Plot Temperature Distribution and Heat Flux
% Plot the solution at the final time step, t = 5.0 seconds, with isothermal lines using a contour plot, and plot the heat flux vector field using arrows.
