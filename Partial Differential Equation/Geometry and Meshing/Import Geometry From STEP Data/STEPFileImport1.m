%% Import Geometry From STEP Data
% This example shows how to import a geometry from a STEP file and then plot the geometry.
% After importing, view the geometry using the pdegplot function.

% Import and view the geometry examples from the STEP files included with Partial Differential Equation Toolboxâ„¢.
% To see the face IDs, set the FaceLabels name-value argument to "on".
% To see the labels on all faces of the geometry, set the transparency to 0.3.
