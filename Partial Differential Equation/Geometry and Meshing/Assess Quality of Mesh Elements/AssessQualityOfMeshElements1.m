%% Assess Quality of Mesh Elements
% Partial Differential Equation Toolboxâ„¢ uses the finite element method to solve PDE problems.
% This method discretizes a geometric domain into a collection of simple shapes that make up a mesh.
% The quality of the mesh is crucial for obtaining an accurate approximation of a solution.

% Typically, PDE solvers work best with meshes made up of elements that have an equilateral shape.
% Such meshes are ideal.
% In reality, creating an ideal mesh for most 2-D and 3-D geometries is impossible because geometries have tiny or narrow regions and sharp angles.
% For such regions, a mesh generator creates meshes with some elements that are much smaller than the rest of mesh elements or have drastically different side lengths.

% As mesh elements become distorted, numeric approximations of a solution typically become less accurate.
% Refining a mesh using smaller elements produces better shaped elements and, therefore, more accurate results.
% However, it also can be computationally expensive.

% Checking if the mesh is of good quality before running an analysis is a good practice, especially for simulations that take a long time.
% The toolbox provides the meshQuality function for this task.

% meshQuality evaluates the shape quality of mesh elements and returns numbers from 0 to 1 for each mesh element.
% The value 1 corresponds to the optimal shape of the element.
% By default, the meshQuality function combines several criteria when evaluating the shape quality.
% In addition to the default metric, you can use the aspect-ratio metric, which is based solely on the ratio of the minimum dimension of an element to its maximum dimension.
