%% Magnetic Flux Density in Electromagnet
% This example shows how to solve a 3-D magnetostatic problem for a solenoid with a finite length iron core.
% Using a ferromagnetic core with high permeability, such as an iron core, inside a solenoid increases magnetic field and flux density.
% In this example, you find the magnetic flux density for a geometry consisting of a coil with a finite length core in a cylindrical air domain.

% The first part of the example solves the magnetostatic problem using a 3-D model.
% The second part solves the same problem using an axisymmetric 2-D model to speed up computations.
