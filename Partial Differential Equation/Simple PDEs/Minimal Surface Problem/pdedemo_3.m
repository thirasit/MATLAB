% Because the coefficient c is a function of the solution u, the minimal surface problem is a nonlinear elliptic problem.
% To solve the minimal surface problem using the programmatic workflow, first create a PDE model with a single dependent variable.
model = createpde;

% Create the geometry and include it in the model. The circleg function represents this geometry.
