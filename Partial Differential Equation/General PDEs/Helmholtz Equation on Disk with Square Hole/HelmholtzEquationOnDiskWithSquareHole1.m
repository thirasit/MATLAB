%% Helmholtz Equation on Disk with Square Hole
% This example shows how to solve a Helmholtz equation using the general PDEModel container and the solvepde function.
% For the electromagnetic workflow that uses ElectromagneticModel and familiar domain-specific language, see Scattering Problem.

% Solve a simple scattering problem, where you compute the waves reflected by a square object illuminated by incident waves that are coming from the left.
% For this problem, assume an infinite horizontal membrane subjected to small vertical displacements U.
% The membrane is fixed at the object boundary.
% The medium is homogeneous, and the phase velocity (propagation speed) of a wave, Î±, is constant.
% The wave equation is
